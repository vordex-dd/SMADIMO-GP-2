Lectures and readings will lay out the fundamental concepts that underpin design as a human activity. Weekly design challenges test your ability to apply those ideas to solve real problems. The course is deliberately broad - spanning all domains of design, including architecture, graphics, services, apparel, engineered goods, and products. The emphasis of the course is the basic design process: define, explore, select, and refine. You, the student, bring to the course your particular interests and expertise related to, for instance, engineering, furniture, fashion, architecture, or products. In prior sessions of the course about half of the participants were novices and about half had prior professional design expertise. Both groups seem to benefit substantially from the course. All project work is evaluated by your peers -- and indeed, you will also be a peer reviewer.

This curriculum gives you skills to effectively implement funded projects, thereby enhancing your career success.

In this course, we explain how to optimize the people, teams, projects, and finances for which you are responsible. \n\nDespite your research training, you are probably facing an urgent training gap in leadership and management skills. Scientific careers falter for non-science reasons when researchers fail to execute a scope of work: struggle to track expenses and returns substantial unspent grant funds; or run out of funds by spending on the wrong people or mismanaging the right people. Consequently, projects close with inadequate progress on aims, thus compromising successful competition for future funding. This course will help avoid these traps.\n\nLeadership and management are essential skills for researchers.

We know that the culture of higher education is different from the culture of the military in meaningful ways, and we also know that one of the keys to excelling in college–especially for student veterans–is learning to navigate these differences successfully, right from the very start.\n\nThis course aims to help you do just that. First, the course will orient you to the norms and expectations of the college classroom. The quicker you know what is expected of you, the quicker you can start learning. Second, the course will offer you strategies to ease your transition, to help you achieve your academic goals, and to allow you to make the most of your college education.\n\nWhile this course is open to everyone, the content has been tailored specifically for student veterans currently pursuing higher education, active duty service members who aspire to start school or return to school soon, and higher education professionals who work to support student veterans at their schools. If this sounds like you, and if you’re ready to learn how to make your transition easier and more successful, then we hope you’ll join us.\n\nThis online curriculum may be used in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, as a start-to finish, self-directed online experience (MOOC). It can also, in its current format, serve as an “orientation” for other student veteran success programs. We also invite you to utilize this resource as a library/toolkit of academic success strategies, a tool for flipped classroom pedagogy, or a companion text for on-the-ground transition courses.\n\nWe welcome the opportunity to assist higher education institutions (both 2-year and 4-year), military installation education services officers and transition assistance programs, veteran focused non-profit organizations, and more.

This course focuses on employing existing bioinformatic resources – mainly web-based programs and databases – to access the wealth of data to answer questions relevant to the average biologist, and is highly hands-on. \n\nTopics covered include multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics, gene expression data analysis, and protein interaction networks, in two separate parts. \n\nThe first part, Bioinformatic Methods I (this one), deals with databases, Blast, multiple sequence alignments, phylogenetics, selection analysis and metagenomics. \n\nThe second part, Bioinformatic Methods II, covers motif searching, protein-protein interactions, structural bioinformatics, gene expression data analysis, and cis-element predictions. \n\nThis pair of courses is useful to any student considering graduate school in the biological sciences, as well as students considering molecular medicine. Both provide an overview of the many different bioinformatic tools that are out there. \n\nThese courses are based on one taught at the University of Toronto to upper-level undergraduates who have some understanding of basic molecular biology. If you're not familiar with this, something like BIO101 from Saylor Academy (https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=349) might be helpful.

Humans are natural network scientists, as we compute new network configurations all the time, almost unaware, when thinking about friends and family (which are particular forms of social networks), about colleagues and organizational relations (other, overlapping network structures), and about how to navigate delicate or opportunistic network configurations to save guard or advance in our social standing (with society being one big social network itself). While such network structures always existed, computational social science has helped to reveal and to study them more systematically. In the first part of the course we focus on network structure. This looks as static snapshots of networks, which can be intricate and reveal important aspects of social systems. In our hands-on lab, you will also visualize and analyze a network with a software yourself, which will help to appreciate the complexity social networks can take on. During the second part of the course, we will look at how networks evolve in time. We ask how we can predict what kind of network will form and if and how we could influence network dynamics.",

For children and youth ages 0-19, motor vehicle traffic death rates among American Indian and Alaska Native children and youths are up to 8 times higher than those of other racial and ethnic groups. This is often due to structural barriers in tribal communities such as lack of lighting, potholes, cattle, etc. This course dives specifically into the effectiveness of taking a Safe Systems approach to road safety in tribal communities.\n\nPerspectives from Safe Systems experts and tribal partners on safe systems approaches to road safety are highlighted as examples from specific communities. The course provides historical context to road safety and specific considerations for roads in tribal nations. Next, the course focuses on how to intervene to create a safe system in communities. In addition, this course will prepare you with information on how to apply for an SS4A grant, with examples from specific communities who have successfully obtained the grant. Throughout the course, resources are provided with tools on how to  apply for SS4A grant and how to implement a safe systems approach.",

        "description": "Each part of the world faces specific vulnerabilities to climate change and has different opportunities to mitigate the effects and build resilience in the 21st century. With the ratification of the Paris Agreement, many countries have acceded to act in combatting climate change. Indeed, without climate action, decades of sustainable development is at risk, thus making this a ‘make or break’ point in time. Showcasing the most recent scientific evidence, explaining the different regional impacts and divulging climate action strategies, along with interactive tools such as a Carbon Footprint Tracker and (I) NDC Platform, this MOOC provides some opportunities, where you can take action on climate change.\n\nAbout the Course\n\nThis action-oriented MOOC gives you the opportunity to learn about regional climate change impacts and sector-specific strategies to increase resilience and move towards a low-carbon future. You will have the opportunity to explore these issues in depth and tailor your learning experience for one or more of the following regions:\n\n•  Latin America and Caribbean\n•  Sub-Saharan Africa\n•  Middle East and North Africa\n•  Eastern Europe and Central Asia\n•  East Asia and Pacific\n•  South Asia\n\n In this endeavor, the MOOC brings together renowned scientists and policymakers to provide a synthesis of the most recent scientific evidence on climate change, regional low emissions and climate resilient development strategies across sectors. A team of expert Instructors will lead discussions around the Paris Agreement, reflections from COP22 and the progress on Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).\n\nCourse Syllabus\n\nOverview \n\n‘From Climate Science to Action’ is divided into four weeks. The first two weeks will provide a comprehensive overview of the scientific evidence for climate change, followed by region-specific insights on the impacts of a warmer world in the 21st century. The last two weeks will focus on action strategies that are being undertaken in different regions and countries to meet the climate challenge, and how you as an individual can take action to avoid a warmer world!\n\nWeek 1:  Climate Change in the 21st Century\n\n•  Historical and projected observed changes in the climate system, leading up to the end of the 21st century\n•  The potential of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted at COP 21 from 187 countries to induce climate action\n•  Trends in climate change impacts, including loss of Arctic sea ice, melting glaciers, increased heat waves and extreme temperatures, and drought and aridity \n•  Possible responses from natural systems, explaining how warming could result in sea-level rise, heat waves and extreme temperatures, and ocean acidification\n\nWeek 2: Sectoral and Regional Impacts\n\n•  Impacts on key development sectors—from warming above pre-industrial temperatures and projected climate trends—across each of the world’s regions\n•  Sectoral impacts focusing on agricultural production, water resources, ecosystem services, and coastal vulnerability for affected populations \n•  Importance of risks with the potential to reverse hard-won development gains and potentially trap millions in poverty, illustrating the need for urgent action now\n\nWeek 3: From Science to Action on Climate Change\n\n•  Region-specific discussions on mitigation actions needed to reduce emissions while decreasing vulnerability to climate change impacts through adaptation and by building climate resilience\n•  Perspectives from regional experts on their experiences in strategies and actions proposed in each region to help transition towards a low-emissions, climate-resilient development path \n•  Discussions on the progress of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), outcomes of the Paris Agreement and reflections from the Conference of Parties (COP)22\n\nWeek 4: What You Can Do\n\n•  Transformative impact of day-to-day changes when brought to a global scale\n•  The rationale for acting now, acting together and acting differently\n•  Examples and expected benefits of mitigation and adaptation policies, considering both contributions to global emission reductions and local development opportunities\n\nIn addition to the core resources and assignments, you may choose to go further, engaging in fun optional exercises, networking, discussion, and diving deeper into our rich selection of supplemental resources. You will have the opportunity to explore these issues in depth and tailor your learning experience for one or more of the following regions:\n\n•  Latin America and Caribbean\n•  Sub-Saharan Africa\n•  Middle East and North Africa\n•  Eastern Europe and Central Asia\n•  East Asia and Pacific\n•  South Asia\n\nCourse Format\n\nThis MOOC has a week-by-week structure, with resources, activities and exercises for you to engage in during each of the four weeks of the course. Each week, you will find a variety of course material, including: \n\n•  Interactive video talks by renowned climate scientists and practitioners \n•  Interactive tools: the Carbon Footprint Tracker, (I) NDC platform\n•  Resources: Core, optional (deep dive) and fun interactives on the week’s theme\n•  Quizzes that check your knowledge, reinforce the lesson’s material and provide immediate feedback\n•  Assignments that will sharpen your skills of analysis, reflection and communication\n•  Discussion forums and social media that enable collaboration with others from around the world, enriching interaction among participants\n•  As a final project, you will create a digital artifact \n\nYou can also go much further than this, engaging in optional exercises, networking, or discussion forums and dive deeper into our rich selection of additional resources.

Even a short speech can motivate people to change long-held beliefs or to take action, and a wonderfully delivered speech can transform a normal person into a leader.\n\nIn this course, Prof. William Kuskin provides a series of pragmatic videos and exercises for successful public speaking and presentations. The course develops through four themes—mastering fear, developing a creative formula, using verbal and body language, and anticipating the room—so that you can discover your personal power as a speaker and give excellent presentations.  \n\nSuccessful presentations do not rely on perfect teeth, a deep voice, or an army of scriptwriters.  They depend largely on the same skills as successful Business Writing and Graphic Design: clarity, structure, and revision. The goal of the course, therefore, is to enable you to discover your own internal power as a speaker and express it to the world.  After this course, with some practice, you will be able to go into any situation and command the room for as long as you like.\n\nThis course can be taken for academic credit as part of CU Boulder’s Master of Science in Data Science (MS-DS) degree offered on the Coursera platform.

The traditional notion of extending products and services designed for advanced economies is no longer as successful in emerging markets. This is primarily because of affordability and accessibility. Moreover, most consumption in emerging markets is unbranded products and services, and unorganized competition. This course identifies five dimensions where emerging markets are different. The traditional approach of think global, act local (glocal) is replaced by a new perspective of think local, act global, especially in large emerging markets such as China and India.",

Basically, it is a repetitive and boring manual task that repeats every month and takes a lot of your time. However, you can easily automate it with SharePoint and Power Automate!\n\nIn this beginner-level guided project \"Automize Monthly Report Creation with Power Automate\", we will create a SharePoint Site and a SharePoint list with data about employees' annual leave days, sick leave days or days off. All the data will be kept in one place. That data will help us to create the Monthly Employee Absence Report. The Power Automate flow will export data from the SharePoint list and save it in an Excel spreadsheet. Then we will send the table (the report) in an email as an Excel table.\n\nThe requirement for this project is having a Microsoft Developer Program account, and you will be provided with instructions on how to get it right here.\n\nIf you are ready to make your and your colleagues’ lives easier by starting to automate manual, time-consuming processes which are hard to track, then this project is for you!

How do people manage to design these complicated chips?  Answer:  a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design.  Our focus in this part of the course is on the key logical and geometric representations that make it possible to map from logic to layout, and in particular, to place, route, and evaluate the timing of large logic networks. Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics covered will include: technology mapping, timing analysis, and ASIC placement and routing.\n\nRecommended Background:\nProgramming experience (C, C++, Java, Python, etc.) and basic knowledge of data structures and algorithms (especially recursive algorithms).  An understanding of basic digital design:  Boolean algebra, Kmaps, gates and flip flops, finite state machine design.  Linear algebra and calculus at the level of a junior or senior in engineering.  Elementary knowledge of RC linear circuits (at the level of an introductory physics class).",

This course is designed for creative professionals — such as screenwriters, musicians, documentary filmmakers or artists — who want to understand the scope and limits of which works can enjoy U.S. copyright protection. The course will introduce students to the workings of copyright law through an examination of the system’s basic principles, rules, and institutions. Topics will include; the justifications for copyright law, copyrightable subject matter, authorship, the nature and scope of copyright’s exclusive rights, fair use, and remedies for infringement. \n\nWe will also explore real-world examples of legal battles surrounding copyright law, from the recent litigation over Robin Thicke’s hit song “Blurred Lines” to more peculiar cases such as the infamous “monkey selfie” case. By understanding what copyright does and does not protect, producers of creative expression will be able to protect and maximize the commercial value of their works.",

We start with a discussion of utility theory to learn how preferences can be represented and modeled for decision making. We first model simple decision problems as multi-armed bandit problems in and discuss several approaches to evaluate feedback. We will then model decision problems as finite Markov decision processes (MDPs), and discuss their solutions via dynamic programming algorithms. We touch on the notion of partial observability in real problems, modeled by POMDPs and then solved by online planning methods. Finally, we introduce the reinforcement learning problem and discuss two paradigms: Monte Carlo methods and temporal difference learning. We conclude the course by noting how the two paradigms lie on a spectrum of n-step temporal difference methods. An emphasis on algorithms and examples will be a key part of this course.",

Las personas que viven en situación de discapacidad presentan mayores niveles de deprivación en diferentes ámbitos: inserción al mercado del trabajo, nivel educacional, etc. \n\nEsto nos obliga como sociedad a repensar nuestro trabajo en esta materia desde un enfoque que garantice igual trato para todos. Pues, una sociedad que espere promover igualdad de oportunidades y espacios de desarrollo para todos sus miembros, debe poner especial atención con aquellos sectores que han sido postergados durante generaciones, esto ocurre con especial fuerza en nuestros países del tercer mundo. No obstante comprender el actual enfoque de Derechos permite orientar la acción hacía planes y programas que permitan garantizar accesibilidad e inclusión social para personas en situación de discapacidad.\n\n\nNosotros buscamos promover que la labor social, laboral o profesional se enmarque en los principios y fundamentos del enfoque de Derechos en discapacidad, por lo que los estudiantes que desarrollen este curso desarrollen una mirada crítica de las prácticas de apoyo de las personas en situación de discapacidad. Posterior a 10 años del nacimiento de la Convención sobre los derechos de las personas con discapacidad, se hace urgente su difusión, comprensión y crítica por parte de los ciudadanos a objeto de modificar prácticas que hoy resultan contradictorias, ilegítimas e innecesarias, las que suelen atentar, en contra de la autonomía y derechos de las personas con discapacidad.\n\nEl propósito del curso es promover que la labor social, laboral o profesional se enmarque en los principios y fundamentos del enfoque de Derechos en discapacidad. De esta manera los los estudiantes podrán reflexionar sobre el enfoque de Derechos consagrado en la Convención de Naciones Unidas sobre Derechos de las Personas con Discapacidad, las diferencias conceptuales entre modelos, enfoques y teorías en el ámbito de la discapacidad en su proceso de tránsito conceptual. De esta manera, los estudiantes analizarán distintos ámbitos de aplicación de dichos modelos y conceptualizaciones en ámbitos de salud, educación y trabajo, comprendiendo una visión integral del desarrollo humano de una sociedad desde el enfoque de derechos humanos.",

One way we can use these methods is in order to construct a \"Tree of Life\" showing how a large collection of related organisms have evolved over time.\n\nIn the first half of the course, we will discuss approaches for evolutionary tree construction that have been the subject of some of the most cited scientific papers of all time, and show how they can resolve quandaries from finding the origin of a deadly virus to locating the birthplace of modern humans.\n\nIn the second half of the course, we will shift gears and examine the old claim that birds evolved from dinosaurs.  How can we prove this?  In particular, we will examine a result that claimed that peptides harvested from a T. rex fossil closely matched peptides found in chickens. In particular, we will use methods from computational proteomics to ask how we could assess whether this result is valid or due to some form of contamination.\n\nFinally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools to reconstruct an evolutionary tree of ebolaviruses and identify the source of the recent Ebola epidemic that caused global headlines.",

        "description": "Applied Sustainability Engineering, the second course in the \"Applied Sustainability for Technical Managers\" specialization discusses the techniques used by engineers and scientists to develop and assess the environmental impact of products and processes required to make those products. It begins with a discussion of different renewable energy technologies and their economics – highlighting how continued reductions in cost have made wind and solar power the least expensive way to generate electricity. It then addresses carbon footprints and how they are determined, applying a practical example where you determine your residential and transportation carbon footprints. From there, the course transitions to defining sustainable and circular products and packaging and showcasing several examples. As Technical Managers, you’ll need metrics for determining whether a product is truly sustainable, so the course introduces techniques such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Streamlined LCA (S-LCA), and the Eco-Audit methodologies. The course concludes with an overview of sustainable product design frameworks, including Cradle-to-Cradle, Design for the Circular Economy, and Biomimicry, just to name a few.\n\nThis course is very practical, introducing you to several areas critical to managing and learning about sustainability initiatives, from assessing the environmental and social impacts of a product or process, to designing more sustainable and circular products. If you want to work towards having a positive impact on the planet and on society, then this course is for you!\n\nThis course was developed in collaboration with Siemens Digital Industries Software and is part of the \"Design for the Circular Economy\" collection. Learners who complete and pass the course can receive an industry-recognized digital badge. \n\nThe “Design for the Circular Economy” microcredential and graduate certificate are developed around the educational goals of providing technical, business, and leadership knowledge and skills that inspire the transformation towards a more circular economy. This includes gaining technical knowledge to apply circular economy principles in product design, minimizing waste and maximizing impact; developing business acumen to implement innovative circular economic models that prioritize sustainability and resilience; and acquiring leadership strategies to communicate effectively and inspire change within an organization. \n\nThis course can be taken for academic credit as part of CU Boulder’s Master of Engineering in Engineering Management (ME-EM) degree offered on the Coursera platform. The ME-EM is designed to help engineers, scientists, and technical professionals move into leadership and management roles in the engineering and technical sectors. With performance-based admissions and no application process, the ME-EM is ideal for individuals with a broad range of undergraduate education and/or professional experience.

ChatGPT will be our guide as we do simple and intermediate level Wireshark packet analysis. We will reconstruct an entire attack and exfiltration campaign, then determine the exact commands used by the attacker. This work usually requires in-depth knowledge of SOC analyst and incident response tools, and of attack patterns in general, but we will see how having a subject matter expert create ChatGPT prompts to perform the investigation can make this a task something that even a novice SOC analyst would be able to complete. This will be a fun exercise, but remember to get your company's permission to do this in a environment or on a computer/virtual machine they approve of if using it at work. Since remnants of malware exist in the traffic, it could cause your antivirus or endpoint protection to alert.",

In this lab you use Cloud Functions and Pub/Sub to create an end-to-end document processing pipeline using Document AI. The Document AI API is a document understanding solution that takes unstructured data, such as documents and emails, and makes the data easier to understand, analyze, and consume.\n\nIn this lab, you will create a document processing pipeline that will automatically process documents that are uploaded to Cloud Storage. The pipeline consists of a primary Cloud Function that processes new files that are uploaded to Cloud Storage using a Document AI form processor and then saves form data detected in those files to BigQuery. If the form data includes any address fields the address data is then written to a Pub/Sub topic that in turn triggers a second Cloud Function that uses to Geocoding API to provide geographic coordinate data for the address that is also written to BigQuery.\n\nThis is a simple pipeline that uses a general form processor that will detect basic form data, such as a labelled field containing address information. Document AI processors that use one of the specialized parsers that are beyond the scope of this lab provide enhanced entity information for specific document types even when those documents do not include labelled fields. For example, a Document AI Invoice parser can provide detailed address and supplier information, from an unlabelled invoice document because it understands the layout of invoices.",

It uses the programming system and language called MATLAB to do so because it is easy to learn, versatile and very useful for engineers and other professionals. MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers. The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent program written in a general-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result, MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences, through all disciplines of engineering, to finance, and beyond, and it is heavily used in industry. Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable skill in today’s job market.\n\nNevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB tutorial. It is an introductory programming course that uses MATLAB to illustrate general concepts in computer science and programming. Students who successfully complete this course will become familiar with general concepts in computer science, gain an understanding of the general concepts of programming, and obtain a solid foundation in the use of MATLAB.\n\nStudents taking the course will get a MATLAB Online license free of charge for the duration of the course. The students are encouraged to consult the eBook that this course is based on. More information about these resources can be found on the Resources menu on the right.",

Old styles of command-control are now a thing of the past, except for the most conservative organizations. While good leaders employ a variety of leadership skills and leadership styles to motivate team members, even this is not enough. Simply setting a common goal and maintaining positive attitudes while raising your emotional intelligence will make you a better leader; but will it truly unlock your team's potential?\n\nInstead of leadership traits, Agile leadership emphasizes facilitation and communication skills. This is teachable and much more powerful. This unique and effective leadership style challenges traditional beliefs in what leadership means.\n\nGreat leaders understand that the leader can no longer stand in the way of their team. Modern society, mindsets, and global competition demand new leadership roles, and leadership qualities all together that empower and motivate the team to new levels of productivity. Business leaders that miss this critical shift in leadership styles concede a powerful competitive advantage to the Agile leader.",

Una población de posibles soluciones de un problema dado es análoga a una población de organismos vivos que evolucionan cada generación, al recombinar los mejores individuos de la población y transmitir sus características de dichos individuos padres, a sus descendientes. En este campo, diferentes esquemas de métodos evolutivos se han desarrollado, los cuales difieren en el tipo de estructuras que conforman la población.\nAlgoritmos evolutivos (AE), como también se le conoce al cómputo evolutivo (EC), se definen como métodos de optimización y búsqueda, los cuales están inspirados y tratan de imitar de manera parcial los procesos de la evolución natural, y mantienen una población de estructuras que evolucionan de acuerdo a reglas de selección y otros operadores genéticos, como cruzamiento y mutación (Bäck, 1996).\nLos algoritmos evolutivos no son los únicos métodos de optimización propuestos a partir de sistemas biológicos. Se tiene una variedad de algoritmos de optimización, que tratan de imitar el comportamiento de sistemas naturales, como las colonias de hormigas, algoritmos culturales y optimización por cúmulos de partículas, entre otros. De aquí surge lo que se conoce como algoritmos bioinspirados, ya que toman sus bases a partir de la estructura de procesos y sistemas biológicos: la evolución, la selección natural, comportamiento social de animales, como las hormigas, abejas, peces.\n\nBÄCK, T.

It begins by defining a sustainable business, one that is inclusive of all stakeholders and how new organizational structures support the sustainable enterprise, enabling the business to go beyond corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. The course highlights sustainable operations and supply chains, recognizing sustainable products need to be manufactured using environmentally and socially responsible practices. Companies are increasingly marketing products as \"green\", and the course discusses truthful advertising, greenwashing, and the value of 3rd-party certifications. Sustainable finance is introduced through the lens of the Triple Bottom Line (TBL), using the Environmental P&L to illustrate a company’s environmental costs.\nESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) is increasingly important today, and companies are communicating their progress through Sustainability reports. The course explores how to read a sustainability report, as well as methodologies to generate them, including GRI and CSRD.\nThe course closes with a discussion of Sustainability Leadership, from starting your own business to effectively communicating with upper management. This course is about empowerment, providing you with the knowledge and tools to be more sustainable in your daily life, in the community where you live, and in the company where you work.\n\nThis course was developed in collaboration with Siemens Digital Industries Software and is part of the \"Design for the Circular Economy\" collection. Learners who complete and pass the course can receive an industry-recognized digital badge. \n\nThe “Design for the Circular Economy” microcredential and graduate certificate are developed around the educational goals of providing technical, business, and leadership knowledge and skills that inspire the transformation towards a more circular economy. This includes gaining technical knowledge to apply circular economy principles in product design, minimizing waste and maximizing impact; developing business acumen to implement innovative circular economic models that prioritize sustainability and resilience; and acquiring leadership strategies to communicate effectively and inspire change within an organization. \n\nThis course can be taken for academic credit as part of CU Boulder’s Master of Engineering in Engineering Management (ME-EM) degree offered on the Coursera platform. The ME-EM is designed to help engineers, scientists, and technical professionals move into leadership and management roles in the engineering and technical sectors.

This in turns allows us to build more detailed quantitative models of cellular function, which can give important insight into applications ranging from biotechnology to human disease. This course gives a broad overview of a variety of current experimental techniques used in modern systems biology, with focus on obtaining the quantitative data needed for computational modeling purposes in downstream analyses. We dive deeply into four technologies in particular, mRNA sequencing, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, flow/mass cytometry, and live-cell imaging. These techniques are often used in systems biology and range from genome-wide coverage to single molecule coverage, millions of cells to single cells, and single time points to frequently sampled time courses. We present not only the theoretical background upon which these technologies work, but also enter real wet lab environments to provide instruction on how these techniques are performed in practice, and how resultant data are analyzed for quality and content.",

This course will first review the principles of asymmetric cryptography and describe how the use of the pair of keys can provide different security properties. Then, we will study the popular asymmetric schemes in the RSA cipher algorithm and the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol and learn how and why they work to secure communications/access. Lastly, we will discuss the key distribution and management for both symmetric keys and public keys and describe the important concepts in public-key distribution such as public-key authority, digital certificate, and public-key infrastructure. This course also describes some mathematical concepts, e.g., prime factorization and discrete logarithm, which become the bases for the security of asymmetric primitives, and working knowledge of discrete mathematics will be helpful for taking this course; the Symmetric Cryptography course (recommended to be taken before this course) also discusses modulo arithmetic.\n\nThis course is cross-listed and is a part of the two specializations, the Applied Cryptography specialization and the Introduction to Applied Cryptography specialization.",

Das Ziel dieses Kurses besteht darin, Ihnen einen Plan und einen Rahmen zu geben, wie Finanzfachleute Entscheidungen treffen.\n\nWir werden die Grundlagen der Finanzbewertung behandeln, den Zeitwert des Geldes, aufgezinste Erträge sowie abgezinste zukünftige Erträge.  Sie werden die Discounted-Cash-Flow(DCF)-Bewertung verstehen und mit anderen Methoden vergleichen.  Außerdem versetzen wir uns in die Köpfe von Finanzmanagern von Großkonzernen und entwickeln die grundlegenden Tools der Investitionsrechnung.  Wir werden uns ansehen, wie, wann und wo Geld ausgegeben wird, werden Abwägungen in Bezug auf Investitionen, Wachstum, Dividenden und die Einhaltung einer gesunden Finanzdisziplin treffen.  Anschließend nehmen wir die Investitionsperspektive der Wall Street bzw. der Kapitalmärkte ein und besprechen die fundamentalen Abwägungen zwischen Risiko und Rendite.  Dann synthetisieren wir unsere Risikodiskussion mit unserem Bewertungsrahmen und nutzen sie für eine Reihe von direkten Anwendungen in der Praxis.\n\nFür diesen Kurs sind keine Vorkenntnisse im Finanzwesen erforderlich.  Er soll vielmehr ein erster Schritt für jeden sein, der Aktienmärkte, Bewertung und Unternehmensfinanzierung verstehen möchte.  Wir werden sämtliche Tools und quantitativen Analysen zusammen durchgehen und einen Leitfaden entwickeln, um die scheinbar komplexen Entscheidungen von Finanzfachleuten verstehen zu können.\n\nBis zum Ende des Kurses werden Sie ein Verständnis für die wesentlichen konzeptionellen Hebel, die bei Finanzentscheidungen betätigt werden, und ihre Beziehung zu anderen Geschäftsbereichen entwickeln.  Dieser Kurs soll Ihnen auch als Orientierung dienen, wie Sie Ihre finanzielle Bildung weiterentwickeln können. Zudem eignet er sich ausgezeichnet als Einführung für alle Stunden, die sich auf BWL oder Finanzwesen spezialisieren wollen, jedoch erst wenig Erfahrung in diesem Bereich haben.",

This competency-based, skill-building course will help non-U.S. students, first-generation immigrants, and foreign-born professionals better understand and master American online learning, as well as other U.S. virtual environments, for college and career success. In the post-COVID era, the course can also be very instrumental in assisting U.S.-based institutions in organizing remote learning activities for their current or prospective international students. \n\nThe current pandemic has disrupted the world of higher education and work as we know it. Many thousands of international students and professionals can no longer travel internationally at will and must now learn how to effectively study and work remotely. To excel in American online learning and work environments, international students and foreign-born professionals need to know how American universities and companies use the Internet to organize study and work, develop and execute projects, communicate ideas, collaborate, and solve organizational and technical problems. By taking this course, you will learn how to enhance your cultural knowledge and assess potential skill gaps that may hinder your online experience or negatively impact your performance in U.S. virtual learning and work environments. Throughout the course you will systematically review competencies required for online work, come to better understand common barriers for non-native students and professionals, learn how to detect and overcome competency gaps, and develop plans for self-improvement and success. We believe that you will find the course useful and gain new knowledge and skills to become more successful in your remote study/work in the U.S. \n\nThe course was previously offered as iMOOC101 and iMOOC102 \"Mastering American e-Learning\".

Knowledge graphs can connect data from both structured and unstructured sources (databases, documents, etc.), providing an intuitive and flexible way to model complex, real-world scenarios. \n\nUnlike tables or simple lists, knowledge graphs can capture the meaning and context behind the data, allowing you to uncover insights and connections that would be difficult to find with conventional databases. This rich, structured context is ideal for improving the output of large language models (LLMs), because you can build more relevant context for the model than with semantic search alone. \n\nThis course will teach you how to leverage knowledge graphs within retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications. You’ll learn to:\n\n1. Understand the basics of how knowledge graphs store data by using nodes to represent entities and edges to represent relationships between nodes.\n\n2. Use Neo4j’s query language, Cypher, to retrieve information from a fun graph of movie and actor data.\n\n3. Add a vector index to a knowledge graph to represent unstructured text data and find relevant texts using vector similarity search.\n\n4. Build a knowledge graph of text documents from scratch, using publicly available financial and investment documents as the demo use case\n\n5. Explore advanced techniques for connecting multiple knowledge graphs and using complex queries for comprehensive data retrieval.\n\n6.

This means acknowledging and embracing your strengths. It also means understanding and learning to manage your weaknesses. It’s tougher than that sounds. How do you know what your strengths and weaknesses are? What are your core personality attributes? How do you make decisions? What’s your decision-making style? How do you know? How do you know accurately?\n\nThis certificate offers an extraordinary opportunity to spend some quality time with yourself to assess your current level of soft skills, clearly define your core self, and build soft skills which are essential to professional, not to mention life, success.\n\nKnowing what you can change and what you can’t is invaluable knowledge. Stop investing in trying to change the unchangeable -- your traits -- and learn to work with them. Stop trying to change others’ traits, too. Learn to work with your strengths, build new skills and perfect existing ones. Then do the same for your team. To start, you must have self-awareness.\n\nYou’ll learn how self-awareness is the super Power Skill, the foundation of all other skills needed to be an effective leader.. They are the most sought-after skills by recruiters and hiring managers. Power skills are key to becoming a great leader.\n\nThe UMD Power Lab includes a curated set of self-assessments offered at a discounted price paid separately from the edX content and certificate. These self-assessments are rigorously developed and cannot be supplemented with free versions that would mislead learners with poor-quality alternatives. The UMD Power Lab is optional but highly recommended for any verified learner in the course. It costs $89 per year and only needs to be purchased once per year for the entire suite of courses in the Re-Imagining Leadership Professional Certificate.\n\nWe've done everything we can to reduce these costs for you, and have built a free SMART Goals Mobile App to help you achieve your goals. Used together this forms a revolutionary design to coach learners at scale in leadership and power skills as a premium but low-cost experience above and beyond learning the course content and earning the edX certificate.",

How to live a sustainable life affects – and connects – everyone and everything.\n\nOver five weeks, you will engage with our team and your fellow course participants to develop an informed response to these major challenges. \n\nThe course has a focus on education and learning; supporting those who want to bring some of the activities and issues covered into their own educational practice.\n\nYou’ll learn more about current global issues and consider how we can all respond, personally or collectively. You’ll explore values and work with others to examine the ways in which local action can be taken on global-scale problems. You’ll have the opportunity to discuss and share ideas, perspectives, and teaching and learning approaches.\n\nWorking in this way, starting from where you are within your own context and educational spaces - and sharing this with others throughout the course - helps us to move towards a new and collective way of thinking and acting for a sustainable future. \n\nYou may also be interested in our 2-week course 'Learning for a Sustainable Future: Live at COP29' https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-live-at-cop29",

In this project, you will learn how to use SQL CASE statements to query tables in a database.\nBy the end of this 2-hour long project, you will be able to write simple CASE statements to retrieve the desired result from a database. Then, we will move systematically to write more complex SQL CASE statements. Furthermore, we will see how to use the CASE clause together with aggregate functions, and SQL joins to get the desired result you want from tables in a database. Also, you will learn how to use the CASE clause to transpose the result of a query.\n\nAlso, for this hands-on project, we will use PostgreSQL as our preferred database management system (DBMS). Therefore, to complete this project, it is required that you have prior experience with using PostgreSQL. Similarly, this project is an advanced SQL concept; so, a good foundation for writing SQL queries, and performing joins in SQL is vital to complete this project.\nIf you are not familiar with writing queries in SQL and SQL joins and want to learn these concepts, start with my previous guided projects titled “Querying Databases using SQL SELECT statement\", “Performing Data Aggregation using SQL Aggregate Functions” and “Mastering SQL Joins”. I taught these guided projects using PostgreSQL. So, taking these projects will give the needed requisite to complete this project on SQL CASE Statements. However, if you are comfortable writing queries in PostgreSQL, please join me on this wonderful ride! Let’s get our hands dirty!",

Many authors and pundits claimed that the world was converging towards a market-friendly democratic place, while gurus and consulting firms were rapidly producing formulae and advice on how to make profits out of the global economy. Decades later, new realities show that globalization does not necessarily mean political, cultural, and economic convergence and that, in fact, forces against it are strong.  \nThis course seeks to help you understand the forces of globalization and how cross-cultural management and the relationship of a multinational organization to various host countries is becoming more and more critical in today’s global economy. This course begins with the discussion of these issues and global relationships and delves into a deeper understanding of business strategy in today’s global business marketplace. \n\nYou will be able to: \n\n• Understand how we got to the present moment of globalization and why it matters \n• Understand the complexities of the current globalization, recognizing not all countries are the same\n• Evaluate the effects of international trade regulations on international business \n• Evaluate when and why companies  operate as multinationals\n\nThis course is part of Gies College of Business’ suite of online programs, including the iMBA and iMSM.

In this course, we also dealt with the early Korean Neo-Confucianism's gaze on “cheon”, referring to “heaven” as an example that clearly demonstrates the characteristics of Korean philosophy before it was given the name “philosophy.” Even before and after the advent of Neo-Confucianism, the search for ultimate existence – expressed in various terms – was constantly pursued.

Upon the completion of this course, you will be able to  \n\n1. Improve the forecasting accuracy by building and validating demand prediction models. \n2. Better stimulate and influence demand by identifying the drivers (e.g., time, seasonality, price, and other environmental factors) for demand and quantifying their impact.\n\nAK is a leading cookware manufacturer in North America. Its newly launched top-line product was gaining momentum in the marketplace. However, a price adjustment at the peak season stimulated a significant demand surge which took AK completely by surprise and resulted in huge backorders. AK faced the risk of losing the market momentum due to the upset customers and the high cost associated with over-time production and expedited shipping. Accurate demand forecast is essential for increasing revenue and reducing cost. Identifying the drivers for demand and assessing their impact on demand can help companies better influence and stimulate demand.\n\nI hope you enjoy the course!",

We’ll divide this fascinating journey into six hands-on projects that will take you from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer. In the process, you will learn - in the most direct and constructive way - how computers work, and how they are designed.\n\nWhat you’ll need:\nThis is a self-contained course: all the knowledge necessary to succeed in the course and build the computer system will be given as part of the learning experience. Therefore, we assume no previous computer science or engineering knowledge, and all learners are welcome aboard. You will need no physical materials, since you will build the computer on your own PC, using a software-based hardware simulator, just like real computers are designed by computer engineers in the field. The hardware simulator, as well as other software tools, will be supplied freely after you enroll in the course.\n\nCourse format:\nThe course consists of six modules, each comprising a series of video lectures, and a project. You will need about 2-3 hours to watch each module's lectures, and about 5-10 hours to complete each one of the six projects. The course can be completed in six weeks, but you are welcome to take it at your own pace. You can watch a TED talk about this course by Googling \"nand2tetris TED talk\".\n\n*About Project-Centered Courses: Project-centered courses are designed to help you complete a personally meaningful real-world project, with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing guidance and suggestions along the way. By actively applying new concepts as you learn, you’ll master the course content more efficiently; you’ll also get a head start on using the skills you gain to make positive changes in your life and career. When you complete the course, you’ll have a finished project that you’ll be proud to use and share.",

        "description": "This course follows the extraordinary development of Western Christianity from its early persecution under the Roman Empire in the third century to its global expansion with the Jesuits of the early modern world. We explore the dynamic and diverse character of a religion with an enormous cast characters. We will meet men and women who tell stories of faith as well as of violence, suppression, and division. Along the way, we encounter Perpetua and her martyrdom in Carthage; the struggles of Augustine the bishop in North Africa; the zeal of Celtic monks and missionaries; the viciousness of the Crusades; the visions of Brigit of Sweden; and the fracturing of Christianity by Martin Luther’s protest. We hear the voices of great theologians as well as of those branded heretics by the Church, a powerful reminder that the growth of Christianity is a story with many narratives of competing visions of reform and ideals, powerful critiques of corruption and venality, and exclusion of the vanquished.  The troubled history of Christian engagement with Jews and Muslims is found in pogroms and expulsions, but also in the astonishing ways in which the culture of the West was transformed by Jewish and Islamic learning.\n \nWe shall explore the stunning beauty of the Book of Kells, exquisitely prepared by monks as the Vikings terrorized the coast of England. We will experience the blue light of the windows of Chartres, and ponder the opening questions of Thomas Aquinas’ great Summa. We will read from the Gutenberg Bible of the fifteenth century, which heralded the revolution brought by the printing press. We will travel from Calvin’s Geneva to Elizabeth’s England to Trent, where a Catholic Council met to inaugurate a modern, missionary Catholic church. We will walk through the great Escorial of Philip II of Spain, hear the poetry of John of the Cross, and follow the Jesuits to Brazil and China.\n \nChristianity in the West was forged in the fires of conflict and tumult, and it brought forth both creativity and violence. It echoed with calls for God’s world to be transformed, it inspired the most sublime art and architecture, yet it also revealed the power of the union of cross and sword to destroy. The course is a journey through the formation of the West as one strand of Christianity, as one chapter in a global story. It is a journey that has shaped our world.",

Like so many of my colleagues, however, I was unprepared for the wave of mental health challenges that would face our society in 2020. From COVID-19 and the devastating economic impacts of the pandemic to racial justice protests, widespread natural disasters, our current cultural moment presents unprecedented mental health concerns, and particularly for marginalized communities. For this reason, I led a field-wide call to action for mental health research and treatment that resulted in this #TalkMentalIllness course. I had the opportunity to speak to over 30 experts from different domains in psychology research, practice, and popular public figures and to discuss the causes and cutting-edge treatments for many serious disorders, the stigma surrounding mental illness in our culture, systemic inequality in mental health treatment, and the mental health challenges of today.\n \n#talkmentalillness curates the interviews from the Mental Health Experts series into an accessible learning experience that will help you have conversations about mental health. Talking about mental illness is both the content and desired outcome of this course, as you will use what you learn from my interviews with mental health experts to guide your own discussions about mental health challenges and treatments with family members, friends, colleagues, and other people in your life. The course will begin by presenting a core set of definitions for mental illness and analyzing the stigma associated with it. We will then apply these topics to specific psychological disorders, including anxiety and mood disorders, eating disorders, suicide, substance use, and psychosis. We will then consider how these issues disproportionately impact marginalized groups and communities of color. The course will conclude by considering innovative approaches to psychological treatments and how the pursuit and science of happiness inform mental health and wellness.\n \nThis course is part of a broader educational mission to share the science of mental illness with both students and the public, both locally and globally. I have designed and created it in collaboration with the Office for Academic Innovation and Libraries’ Media Services Team at the University of Colorado Boulder.\n\n- June Gruber",

This project can help you turn the boring, repetitive business process into a quick solution with just a few clicks.\n\nIn this 1-hour long guided project, you will learn to create a SharePoint list and set up Power Automate flows for the following process: when an employee of your imaginary company wants a new piece of equipment, they will create a request in SharePoint and if it exceeds a certain amount of money, the general manager must approve it. At the end of the month, all requests are collected into an HTML table and sent via email to the department in charge of ordering the equipment, and the person who made the request receives an email that their request has been approved and the equipment will be ordered. \n\nSince this project uses SharePoint (an Office 365 service) and Power Automate (part of the Microsoft Power Platform), you will need access to a Microsoft account and a Microsoft 365 Developer Program subscription. In the video at the beginning of the project you will be given instructions on how to sign up for both.\n\nLet’s get started with automating manual, time-consuming business processes!",

        "description": "This course is an introduction to the basic concepts of programming languages, with a strong emphasis on functional programming. The course uses the languages ML, Racket, and Ruby as vehicles for teaching the concepts, but the real intent is to teach enough about how any language “fits together” to make you more effective programming in any language -- and in learning new ones.\n\nThis course is neither particularly theoretical nor just about programming specifics -- it will give you a framework for understanding how to use language constructs effectively and how to design correct and elegant programs. By using different languages, you will learn to think more deeply than in terms of the particular syntax of one language. The emphasis on functional programming is essential for learning how to write robust, reusable, composable, and elegant programs. Indeed, many of the most important ideas in modern languages have their roots in functional programming. Get ready to learn a fresh and beautiful way to look at software and how to have fun building it.\n\nThe course assumes some prior experience with programming, as described in more detail in the first module.\n\nThe course is divided into three Coursera courses: Part A, Part B, and Part C.  As explained in more detail in the first module of Part A, the overall course is a substantial amount of challenging material, so the three-part format provides two intermediate milestones and opportunities for a pause before continuing.  The three parts are designed to be completed in order and set up to motivate you to continue through to the end of Part C.  The three parts are not quite equal in length: Part A is almost as substantial as Part B and Part C combined.\n\nWeek 1 of Part A has a more detailed list of topics for all three parts of the course, but it is expected that most course participants will not (yet!) know what all these topics mean.",

        "description": "As the world’s population continues to rise toward an expected 10 billion citizens by 2050, it is imperative that business practices change to ensure a high quality of life is possible for all of us, both human and non-human. Today’s learners are very aware of this. Moreover, they are highly motivated and have the extraordinary capacity to create a future that provides both economic success and a more enduring, resilient, and sustainable planet.  If you are one of these learners, then Sustainability and the Circular Economy is a course for you. \n\nSustainability and the Circular Economy is the first course in the Applied Sustainability for Technical Managers specialization and builds the foundation for the rest of the specialization. It aims to provide learners with the strategies and tools to realize their vision by integrating sustainability into everyday life, and in the companies where they work. \n\nThe course opens with an examination of climate change and human impact on the environment, and the opportunities created for innovative solutions that drive real change.  We then explore the sources of many of our environmental challenges, and the need to transition to a zero-carbon energy future. \n\nA sustainable future is more than just renewable energy, as we need to pay attention to our ever-growing desire for products that add value to our lives. Therefore, the course explores how we’re electrifying transportation, making our homes more energy efficient, eating more sustainable food grown with regenerative agricultural practices, and wearing clothes designed to last and made from more natural materials using fair and equitable labor. \n\nIt is important to recognize that many of the 10 billion global citizens will want the same products and lifestyles as citizens in wealthier industrialized nations. Yet products require materials - and our current extractive approach to resources will not meet this burgeoning demand.  The course concludes with an overview of the Circular Economy, an innovative way of decoupling such economic growth from traditional resource extraction.   \n\nThis course was developed in collaboration with Siemens Digital Industries Software and is part of the \"Design for the Circular Economy\" collection. Learners who complete and pass the course can receive an industry-recognized digital badge.\n\nThe “Design for the Circular Economy” microcredential and graduate certificate are developed around the educational goals of providing technical, business, and leadership knowledge and skills that inspire the transformation towards a more circular economy. This includes gaining technical knowledge to apply circular economy principles in product design, minimizing waste and maximizing impact; developing business acumen to implement innovative circular economic models that prioritize sustainability and resilience; and acquiring leadership strategies to communicate effectively and inspire change within an organization. \n\nThis course can be taken for academic credit as part of CU Boulder’s Master of Engineering in Engineering Management (ME-EM) degree offered on the Coursera platform. The ME-EM is designed to help engineers, scientists, and technical professionals move into leadership and management roles in the engineering and technical sectors. With performance-based admissions and no application process, the ME-EM is ideal for individuals with a broad range of undergraduate education and/or professional experience.

        "description": "The goal of this capstone spacecraft dynamics project is to employ the skills developed in the rigid body Kinematics, Kinetics and Control courses.  An exciting two-spacecraft mission to Mars is considered where a primary mother craft is in communication with a daughter vehicle in another orbit.  The challenges include determining the kinematics of the orbit frame and several desired reference frames, numerically simulating the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft in orbit, and implementing a feedback control that then drives different spacecraft body frames to a range of mission modes including sun pointing for power generation, nadir pointing for science gathering, mother spacecraft pointing for communication and data transfer.  Finally, an integrated mission simulation is developed that implements these attitude modes and explores the resulting autonomous closed-loop performance. \n\nTasks 1 and 2 use three-dimensional kinematics to create the mission related orbit simulation and the associated orbit frames.  The introductory step ensures the satellite is undergoing the correct motion, and that the orbit frame orientation relative to the planet is being properly evaluated.\n\nTasks 3 through 5 create the required attitude reference frame for the three attitude pointing modes called sun-pointing, nadir-pointing and GMO-pointing.  The reference attitude frame is a critical component to ensure the feedback control drives the satellite to the desired orientation.  The control employed remains the same for all three pointing modes, but the performance is different because different attitude reference frames are employed.  \n\nTasks 6 through 7 create simulation routines to first evaluate the attitude tracking error between a body-fixed frame and a particular reference frame of the current attitude mode.  Next the inertial attitude dynamics is evaluated through a numerical simulation to be able to numerically analyze the control performance.\n\nTasks 8-11 simulate the closed-loop attitude performance for the three attitude modes.  Tasks 8 through 10 first simulate a single attitude at a time, while tasks 11 develops a comprehensive attitude mission simulation which considers the attitude modes switching autonomously as a function of the spacecraft location relative to the planet.\n\nThe material covered is taking from the book  \"Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems\" available at https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.105210.",

        "description": "If you really care about the big questions in the economies and societies of the 21st century, such as distributive justice - namely, inequality of income or wealth, and its correlation with economic growth - this course is meant for you. The knowledge you will gain can truly change your outlook on our world.\n\n\"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice -  Maximizing Social Wellbeing\" is the second part of a two part course and it includes the following five lectures: \n(1) The excess burden of taxation\n(2) Tax incidence: who bears the economic burden of tax?\n(3) Progressivity: definition and ways to achieve\n(4) Low Income, Low Ability and the Optimal Income Tax Model\n(5) Designing the Tax and Transfer System that Maximizes Social Wellbeing\nIf you haven't done that already, we strongly recommend that you register for the first part of the course: \"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice - the Role of the State\". Taking both parts of the course would enable you to obtain a fuller and more comprehensive knowledge about Economic Growth and Distributed Justice.\n\nThe course is founded upon the elemental idea that the role of the state is to maximize the well-being - or simply the happiness - of its residents. In 9 fascinating, edifying lessons, using only simple words and decoding professional terminologies that sometimes baffle the intelligent layman, the course expounds many truths – both intuitive and unintuitive. Often using examples from the US and Europe, it does not however focus on policies in any particular region of the world, and is directly applicable to all countries around the globe.\n\nThe course touches upon the essence of important concepts like efficiency and equity, inequality and poverty, gross domestic product, tax evasion and tax planning; it presents the work of Nobel Laureate James Mirrlees and his followers - promoting a coherent system that integrates tax and government expenditures to maximize social welfare; and illuminates a range of high-profile issues from their economic angle:\n• Climate change: the atmosphere and oceans as public goods, and how smart (Pigovian) taxation can be used to combat the rapidly increasing threats to our planet;\n• Technology as the engine of economic growth;\n• Taxing the rich: How can we mitigate the growing inequality problem? Should we   impose a global tax on capital?\n\nThe curriculum includes interviews with major figures in the fields of law and of economics:  Harvard's Elhanan Helpman, Dan Shaviro from NYU and Richard Epstein from the University of Chicago and NYU.\n\nAfter successfully completing this course, you can expect to be able to:\n• better understand economic issues presented in the media\n• form an informed opinion on the strengths and weaknesses of presented social economic policies\n• define and measure inequality and poverty\n• define the connection between inequality (income, wealth) and economic growth\n• explain the foundations of economic growth\n• design a tax and transfer system to maximize the happiness of individuals\n\nAll these will allow you to better understand the policies being developed around you, and to play a larger, more informed role in their development, as a conscientious citizen.\n\n\nIn order to receive academic credit for this course you must successfully pass the academic exam on campus. For information on how to register for the academic exam – https://tauonline.tau.ac.il/registration\n\nAdditionally, you can apply to certain degrees using the grades you received on the courses. Read more on this here – \nhttps://go.tau.ac.il/b.a/mooc-acceptance\n\nTeachers interested in teaching this course in their class rooms are invited to explore our Academic High school program here – https://tauonline.tau.ac.il/online-highschool\n\nThis course is a direct extension of the first part \"Economic Growth and Distributive Justice Part I -The Role of the State\", so if you have not yet taken it, we highly recommend you start your learning from there (https://www.coursera.org/learn/economic-growth-part-1/home/welcome).\n\nThis course will temporarily close for enrollment from March 1st, 2022 to August 31st, 2022. During this time, the course will be closed for new enrolments. All of the course materials will continue to be able available to previously enrolled learners; however, the course staff will not provide support in the Discussion Forums during this period. \n\nBest,\nThe Tel Aviv University Team",

You will learn why interest rates have always been a key barometer in determining the value of everything.  You will explore the changing influence of interest rates; the impact of interest rates on consumption, investment and economic growth; and the bizarre realities of negative interest rates. Markets explains how interest rates change the value of all financial instruments, highlighting the role of the bond and stock markets that have toppled empires.  We take a closer look at the equity pricing models and equity markets that reverberate across the globe, and explore everything from the first stock ever issued – by the Dutch East India Company – to the little-understood but powerful derivative securities market.  By the end of the course, you will have developed insight into the intersections of the financial markets with worlds of policy, politics, and power. You will have demonstrated that insight by teaching an important financial concept and translating a financial product or transaction to someone who will clearly benefit from your advice.",

Which are comminglings and exchanges which produced its most complete fruit, i.e. the city, a place for landscape-modelling communities? And which elements did contribute to build up that baulk of customs, ideas, and innovations which compelled to confrontation and hybridizations different peoples for millennia? What did it made, from pottery to metallurgy, from gastronomy to architecture, from art to religion, of a sea a cradle of civilization? Archaeology may help in disentangling such questions, seeking unexpected answers , by tinkering what ancient Mediterranean peoples left buried in the ground. A privileged point of view of our course is the ancient Phoenician city of Motya, located exactly at the centre of the “sea in the middle”. Throughout the live experience of excavation, with images taken on the field, this course will let you touch the many tesserae of the great mosaic of the Mediterranean Civilization. The field diary of the archaeologist, and the handpick will be the two tools, which will lead us across the sea to discover what such early cities actually were, and how their contribute is still a major part of our shared memory.",

LMEs occupy areas of coastal ocean at least 200 000 km² or greater in size. These coastal waters produce 12.6 trillion USD in ecosystem goods and services annually and are vitally important for billions of people around the globe.\n\nBecause LMEs are bounded by ocean features and are globally linked, management of human activities needs to occur in an integrated fashion across political boundaries and economic sectors (e.g. fishing, shipping, energy, tourism, and mining). This represents a new type of management, approached by shifting from single-sector based to multi-sector assessment and management, within the spatial domain of the world's 66 Large Marine Ecosystems. There is global high-level support for this new approach and in this course, we will introduce the concepts and tools for assessing and managing LMEs.\n\nTogether, leaders and experts in a global movement to recover and sustain the goods and services of LMEs will introduce you to the mechanisms used for assessment (Transboundary Diagnostic Analysis), planning and implementation (Strategic Action Programme). Based on recent activities in implementation and practice of the LME approach projects around the globe, we will showcase examples of effective management at this scale, and highlight the challenges and issues. By the end of the online course, we hope you will be able to actively use this knowledge to advance sustainable development of the world’s oceans.\n\nThe course was created with the support and input of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), UNESCO-IOC and IW:LEARN.",

        "description": "Bioprocesses make use of microorganisms, animal cells, or enzymes to manufacture new products or complete a chemical transformation. Since ancient days, humans have been using microorganisms to transform biological materials for the production of alcoholic beverages and other fermented foods. Since then, bioprocesses have been developed for an enormous range of commercial products, from relatively cheap products such as organic solvents and industrial alcohol, to expensive specialty chemicals such as therapeutic proteins, antibiotics, and vaccines. Nowadays, the development of bioprocesses is an essential part of a large number of chemical, food, and pharmaceutical industries.\nThe main purpose of the course “Introduction to Industrial Bioprocess Development” is to provide an overview of the common stages involved in this type of processes.\n\nThe course is primarily aimed at students, researchers, and professionals with an interest in bioprocessing, biomanufacturing, or fermentation technology. Some knowledge of biology, biotechnology and/or biochemical engineering will be advantageous, but not mandatory. \n\nThe course begins with a brief description of some basic properties of microorganisms and general aspects related to their use in bioprocesses at industrial scale. Following this, the kinetic bases for cell growth, substrate utilization and product formation during batch, continuous and fed-batch cultures are discussed. In addition, the course includes a group of lectures dedicated to some stages that precede fermentation; specifically, media formulation, sterilization, preservation of microorganisms and inoculum preparation. The main characteristics of predominant types of industrial bioreactors along with process parameters that need to be controlled in stirred tank reactors are also covered in one of the modules of the course. Since the expansion of a bioprocess from a lab scale to an industrial scale is of considerable importance, an additional lecture dedicated to this topic is presented. The last part of the course provides a general overview of downstream processing, addressing processes used for the removal of cells from the culture medium, methods for the disruption of cells, and isolation of the target bioproduct.\n\nBy the end of the course, you should:\n\n# Be able to identify the fundamental difference between the two basic cell types: eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells\n# Distinguish the main steps of the brewing process\n# Identify some important steps in recombinant protein production\n# Define the different stages of the industrial production of bioethanol\n# Distinguish the main characteristics of the three fermentation modes: batch, continuous and fed-batch\n# Define important parameters of the continuous fermentation mode\n# Identify bioprocesses where fed-batch fermenters are used and for how long can a fed-batch process be run\n# Identify how defined and undefined fermentation media are formulated\n# Discuss the role that key components of culture media play in bioconversion processes\n# Recognize the importance in avoiding microbial contamination\n# Describe chemical and physical sterilization methods\n# Distinguish the main characteristics of common techniques of cell preservation\n# Recognize factors that are commonly considered to obtain an inoculum suitable for fermentation at industrial scale\n# Define what a bioreactor is and in which industrial bioprocesses are commonly used\n# Identify the main parameters that need to be controlled during microbial conversions in STRs\n# List relevant parameters that are considered for scale-up purposes\n# Define the sequential steps of downstream processing\n# Distinguish different methods for biomass removal or cell harvesting\n# Select common unit operations used for primary isolation",

He examines the meaning and significance of four key virtues—kindness, hope, humility, and generosity—and their importance to living a good life. \n\nFurther, you will consider the practical aspects of living a virtuous life. We will discuss the challenges to living the virtues, and examine how they can be cultivated by incorporating contemplative practices in your everyday life. \n\nWeek 1 draws on baptism as our initiation into a new story and way of being in the world. In Week 1, you will explore the virtue of kindness through the character of God, reflected in how we treat ourselves and others. Week 2 focuses on hope. In Week 3, you will explore the virtue of humility, and reflecting on the paradox that trying to be humble often ends in pride. Finally, Week 4 closes with an exploration of generosity, demonstrating how different virtues reveal the God who is unrelentingly generous.",

That translates into the fact that more than half of the world’s population is already living in cities. Experts forecast that very soon Africa will become one of the most urbanized continents. However, almost 70% of world’s urban population is living in the cities where governments are struggling to provide basic services like sanitation, schools, hospitals, and adequate clean water. \n\nThe reason is that, their governments do not have enough money. This may also be true also for the city where you live or work. Poor infrastructure affects your daily life. Local governments struggle with mobilizing finances so that they can improve your quality of life but many times they are not aware of the right mechanisms. \n\nImagine that your government wants to know how can they finance cities and they want you to advise – where will you begin with? Our finance experts are bringing their experience right at your Desk through this MOOC. This MOOC has five modules and in five weeks you will learn:\n•\tFinancial decision making environment in urban systems\n•\tMechanisms for mobilizing local revenues\n•\tInnovative mechanisms for financing infrastructure projects through partnerships, and \n•\tFinancial decision making under uncertainties and risks\n\nWe will provide you a carefully selected set of literature, quizzes and interactive discussion forums. So join our MOOC and find out the ways to make your city a better place to live in for yourself and for your next generations.\n\n(This MOOC was developed in collaboration with the United Cities and Local Governments of Africa (UCLG-Africa), African Local Governments Academy (ALGA), and Erasmus University Rotterdam)",

Most of us know that vocals serve as the focal point of modern recordings but many do not know the tools used or when the tools are used best in modern record production.\n\nThe course begins with simple vocal placement in a mix, where you will also learn the fundamentals of compression and equalization. You’ll further study delays and reverbs before moving to advanced concepts in audio editing, synthetic processing, automatic & graphic pitch correction, time compression, time expansion, flex and elastic audio. \n\nThrough analysis and/or hands on projects that the students will post for peer review, the student will gain an understanding of the many choices available to modern record producers as they record and mix with a modern tool set. You’ll see, in action, the Vocoder, Auto-Tune, Melodyne, Elastic Audio, Flex Time, VocAlign, tempo based editing and a host of other file modification protocols that are readily available on most Digital Audio Workstations. This course gives students a thorough look at the expanded choices that have risen in the art of vocal production as a result of these modern tools.\n\nThe goal of the course is to help interested novices understand the recordings they are listening to, performers find an expanded language for their recorded voices and for vocal producers to be able to create musically artistic visualizations using singers as their paintbrushes.",

Although there are other formal paradigms of the blues, such as 8-bar or 16-bar, this course focuses on different incarnations of the 12-bar blues. There are considerable differences between Early Jazz blues, Swing blues, Bebop blues, Modal blues, and Post Bop blues. Each type has its unique harmonic syntax, melodic vocabulary and, associated with them, improvisational techniques. While other aspects of jazz performance practice have been constantly changing from one stylistic convention to another, the blues has never lost its identity and expressive power, and continues to exert a powerful influence on the harmonic and melodic syntax of jazz.\n\nThis seven-week course explores important aspects of the blues, blues improvisation, basic keyboard textures, jazz harmonic and melodic syntax. Topics include: (1) Blues Progressions; (2) Blues and Other Scales; (3) Improvisational Tools, and others. This course will also cover valuable theoretical concepts enabling the student to master the art of jazz improvisation. Each topic will be introduced from a practical perspective with the clearly stated goal: to improve one’s improvisational skills. Jazz improvisation is rooted in spontaneity, creativity, self-expression and, at the same time, self-control and order. A unique pedagogical approach based on a one-to-one musical interaction conducted with different instrumentalists will help to reinforce many of the concepts introduced in this course and realize its stated objectives.",

Biology is moving from molecular to modular. As our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists of molecules (proteins, lipids, ions) involved in cellular processes, we need to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form modules that act as discrete functional systems. These systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal transduction, transcription, motility and electrical excitability. In turn these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion, proliferation and action potentials. What are the properties of such subcellular and cellular systems? What are the mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise? What types of experiments inform systems-level thinking? Why do we need computation and simulations to understand these systems?\n\nThe course will develop multiple lines of reasoning to answer the questions listed above. Two major reasoning threads are: the design, execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that produce large data sets; quantitative reasoning, models and simulations. Examples will be discussed to demonstrate “how” cell- level functions arise and “why” mechanistic knowledge allows us to predict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses.",

It allows automated analysis based on behavioural models of a system to see if a system works correctly.

It allows to design embedded system behaviour that is structurally sound and as a side effect forces you to make the behaviour simple and insightful. \nThis means that the systems are not only behaving correctly, but are also much easier to maintain and adapt. ’Modeling Software Protocols, and other behaviour' demonstrates the power of formal methods in software modelling, communication protocols, and other examples. \nReading material.

The fundamental concepts studied in this course will reappear in many other classes and business settings. Our focus will be on interpreting the meaning of the results in a business and managerial setting.\n\nWhile you will be introduced to some of the science of what is being taught, the focus will be on applying the methodologies. This will be accomplished through use of Excel and using data sets from many different disciplines, allowing you to see the use of statistics in very diverse settings. The course will focus not only on explaining these concepts but also understanding the meaning of the results obtained. \n\nYou will be able to: \n\n• Test for beliefs about a population\n• Compare differences between populations\n• Use linear regression model for prediction\n• Use Excel for statistical analysis\n\nThis course is part of Gies College of Business’ suite of online programs, including the iMBA and iMSM.

Artists, teachers, health care providers, scientists and most children try to understand the human form from stick figure drawings to electron microscopy. Learning the form of people is of great interest to us – physicians, nurses, physician assistants, emergency medical services personnel and many, many others.\n\nLearning anatomy classically involved dissection of the deceased whether directly in the laboratory or from texts, drawings, photographs or videos.  There are many wonderful resources for the study of anatomy.  Developing an understanding of the human form requires significant work and a wide range of resources.\n\nIn this course, we have attempted to present succinct videos of human anatomy.  Some will find these images to be disturbing and these images carry a need to respect the individual who decided to donate their remains to benefit our teaching and learning.\n\nAll of the dissections depicted in the following videos are from individuals who gave their remains to be used in the advancement of medical education and research after death to the Yale School of Medicine.\n\nThe sequence of videos is divided into classic anatomic sections.  Each video has a set of learning objectives and a brief quiz at the end.  Following each section there is another quiz covering the entire section in order for you to test your knowledge.  \n\nWe hope these videos will help you better understand the human form, make time that you may have in the laboratory more worthwhile if you have that opportunity and help you develop an appreciation of the wonderful intricacies of people.\n\nANATOMY OF THE CHEST, NECK, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS WAS PRODUCED IN PART DUE TO THE GENEROUS FUNDING OF THE DAVID F.

Este curso busca facilitar la comprensión de cómo es ese proceso y, para ello, se enfoca exclusivamente en el subsector de la energía eléctrica. \n\nPara desarrollar un proyecto de ciencia de datos energéticos se necesita que confluyan dos tipos de conocimiento: por una parte, un conocimiento sobre el sector eléctrico (cómo es su estructura, cuáles son sus principales retos, cómo funciona) y , por otra, un conocimiento sobre la ciencia de datos (cuáles son sus fundamentos, cómo opera, qué tipo de aportes puede dar). Por esa razón, es usual que se constituyan equipos interdisciplinarios en los que confluyen tanto expertos en energía como expertos en análisis de datos. \n\nNo es fácil para estos expertos poder dialogar, porque el conocimiento especializado suele tener también un lenguaje especializado y no es fácil compartir la experticia con personas que no son especialistas en nuestro campo de conocimiento. \n\nJustamente, este curso busca ayudar a facilitar ese diálogo y a sobrepasar esas barreras de comunicación. \n\nPara ello, lo que haremos será presentar los elementos básicos, fundamentales de cada una de las dos áreas del conocimiento con una perspectiva más amplia que profunda. El propósito es el de adquirir una comprensión de alto nivel de tanto los elementos del sector eléctrico como de la ciencia de datos. Aspiramos que, al finalizar exitosamente este curso, usted pueda entender y explicar cómo funciona el proceso de ciencia de datos aplicado a los problemas del sector eléctrico.\n\n¿Cómo está estructurado el curso? El curso tiene seis módulos y en cada uno de esos módulos trabajamos un tema del área de energía y un tema del área de ciencia de datos, que confluyen en una aplicación concreta o, al menos, en una etapa de una aplicación concreta. En cada módulo, usted encontrará:\n- videos explicativos\n- un laboratorio no calificado\n- un laboratorio calificado\n- un cuestionario calificado.\n\nLos laboratorios son espacios para desarrollar tareas en lenguaje Python. No esperamos que usted sea un experto desarrollador de programas en Python, pero sí que tenga algún tipo de experticia en programación. \n\n¿Para quién es este curso? Hemos imaginado este curso teniendo en mente dos posibles perfiles:\n1) un perfil de alguien con conocimientos sobre el sector energético que quiere explorar qué puede aprovechar de la ciencia de datos; y\n2) un perfil de alguien con conocimientos en ciencia de datos que quiere explorar cómo puede aportar esos conocimientos en el área del sector energético. Por ej.: Este curso está dedicado principalmente a estudiantes universitarios de primer y segundo año interesados en ciencia e ingeniería, junto con estudiantes de secundaria y profesionales interesados en programación.",

Unlike other more \"classic\" digital circuits courses, our interest focuses more on the system than on the electronics that support it. This approach will allow us to lay the foundation for the design of complex digital systems.\n\nYou will learn a set of design methodologies and will use a set of (educational-oriented) computer-aided-design tools (CAD) that will allow you not only to design small and medium size circuits, but also to access to higher level courses covering so exciting topics as application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) design or computer architecture, to give just two examples.\n\nCourse topics are complemented with the design of a simple processor, introduced as a transversal example of a complex digital system. This example will let you understand and feel comfortable with some fundamental computer architecture terms as the instruction set, microprograms and microinstructions.\n\nAfter completing this course you will be able to:\n\n   * Design medium complexity digital systems.\n   * Understand the description of digital systems using high-level languages such as VHDL.\n   * Understand how computers operate at their most basic level (machine language).",

Through interviews with industry experts in this area, you will be able to analyze innovations powering the rapid spread of information technology and how they present new challenges for protecting data. For example, mobile devices increase convenience but often bypass traditional security measures. After this course, you will be able to describe how the nature of the threat evolves, as culprits employ a burgeoning set of sophisticated tools to take advantage of our growing reliance on networks for critical-data exchange.\n\nIf you want to pursue a career in the public sector, the stakes are high as well. The proliferation of hackers, inevitable human errors, bring-your-own-device (BYOD) initiatives, and the ever-broadening need to share information weigh heavily on government and education organizations, and consume substantial resources. The Pentagon, for example, has proposed to spend $23 billion on network security initiatives through 2018. This sounds like a large sum, until you consider the scope and importance of the U.S. government information resources this investment must protect.\n\nAfter completing the course modules you will be able to explain how yesterday’s prevention strategies are no longer adequate for stopping advanced, targeted attacks. Effective cybersecurity must be multi-dimensional and tiered, as threats can originate from virtually anywhere, target numerous levels of an organization, and sometimes persist for months or years before an information security staff is aware of an attack or breach. Therefore securing networks requires a holistic approach that incorporates several elements.",

In order to prepare for this, not only the school, but also all the actors who make up the world of education must grasp new challenges characterized by an unprecedented internationalization.\n \nThe main objective of this MOOC is to understand how events that are far away from school actors can impact their daily life: to do so, we will proceed by playing with scale and will alternate between presentations of global issues and local responses. \n\nThe second key objective is to better understand the themes that structure what we will call here the field of international education; in other words, an education impacted by the interdependencies of the world. We will deal with migration, forced migration, North-South relations, international cooperation and global citizenship education.\n \nThrough modules and lessons, you will have the keys to better understand these themes and resources to deepen their understanding. You will be able to mobilize concepts and various theoretical resources to analyze, put into perspective and criticize the developments that the world of education is following in a globalized context.",

        "description": "This course is multidisciplinary in nature, and aims to equip the global audience of interested lay people, people with chronic disease, public health researchers, health clinicians, students, administrators, and researchers to reflect on the overall impact of the burden of chronic disease . It shows how all chronic diseases (obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer) are related by a set of common causes, and that such diseases should be tackled, not individually, but as part of a complex system, with interrelated contributing factors. These factors are genetic, environmental, psychological, economic, social, developmental, and media related. \n\nThe Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney is a unique interdisciplinary education and research hub which seeks solutions to chronic disease through a complex systems approach. Academics in many disciplines (in Science and Medicine, but also in Architecture, Humanities, Law etc)  work in a collaborative fashion to produce novel solutions to the problems of chronic disease.  All contributors and participants in this course are members of the Charles Perkins Centre and will  speak from the unique interdisciplinary perspective that this Centre affords. \n\nThe course will describe a complex systems approach as the most productive way to ease the burden of chronic disease. It then describes  these diseases in detail, their risk factors, and the environmental and biological factors that have led to the  current epidemic of  obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Finally, the solutions – and more importantly the process for finding solutions- is the subject of the last module. No one approach by itself can ever be the answer, and certainly not a simple diet and exercise approach. \n\nThe entire course consists of 5 content modules, plus an extra module for completing assignments and discussions, and takes about 6 weeks to complete. Completion certificates are issued on the basis of participation in all 6 modules. \n\nWhat you'll learn: \n-\tHow the Charles Perkins Centre recruits interdisciplinary teams to ease the burden of chronic disease\n-\tHow a complex systems approach is necessary to provide solutions to a complex problem\n-\tThe fundamentals of chronic disease research and where it is heading\n-\tThe biggest risk factors for chronic disease and their global incidence\n-\tThe biological, genetic, social, regulatory, and other influences that have inflated these risk factors\n-\tHow to provide solutions globally for the reduction of chronic disease",

Of course, there is always a person or multiple persons in the company who can give those answers, but there is a much better way of providing your colleagues with information they need then chasing those all-knowing employees for answers, and that is a fully automated chatbot created with Power Virtual Agent, which is one of the 4 main parts of the Power Platform.\n\nIn this 35-minutes long guided project, “Use SharePoint & Power Virtual Agent to Create Smart Chatbot”, you will create a SharePoint site and list, add some data to it and create a Power Virtual Agent chatbot which will automate the information flow from your company to the employees. Once the chatbot is up and running, you and your colleagues won’t have to bother other colleagues in person or send them emails or texts anymore, you will be able to have a nice and easy-going conversation with the bot behind the chatbot and find out the information you need. Since this project uses Office 365 services like SharePoint and Power Virtual Agent (part of the Microsoft Power Platform), you will need access to a Microsoft account and a Microsoft 365 Developer Program subscription account. In the video at the beginning of the project you will be given instructions on how to sign up for both.\n\nIf you are ready to create your artificial co-worker which will help you and your colleagues provide information to others, then this project is for you! Let's get started!",

This course will provide you with an introduction to the most recent research in the field of health effects of air pollution as well as a broader understanding of sources and spread of air pollution and what we should do about it.\n \nWhat is air pollution? What are the sources? How and where are we exposed outdoors and indoors? What happens in the body? Which diseases are the result? Who are the most vulnerable? How can we assess the effects of air pollution? And what should we do to reach the Sustainable Development Goal to “substantially reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and air, water and soil pollution”? These are some of the important questions we will address in the course.\n\nDuring the course you will meet researchers and experts from the University of Copenhagen and the Technical University of Denmark. They work with different aspects of air pollution and health: toxicology, exposure assessment, epidemiology, engineering and health impact assessment. It is a global responsibility to combat the health impacts of air pollution, and this fight can only be won through new knowledge and global collaboration. \n\nWe hope you will join us in the course and equip yourself to take part in this global and individual health challenge.",

Within this network of companies, there are three ongoing flows: products,  information, and finances. To properly understand and manage the supply chain, you need to understand all the flows.  If you do not consider all of the flows, you will miss opportunities or sub-optimize parts of the supply chain.\nThe last of five courses in this specialization is a capstone. You will have the opportunity to show what you learned and apply it to your Supply Chain Excellence project. It will consist of four modules, which will cover the following topics: product flow strategy; information flow strategy; how to use the supply chain to create financial success; and finally, the capstone case study.\nYou will have lectures, readings, and discussions with your peers for each topic, as well as a practice quiz in each lesson. At the end of each module, you can put your knowledge to the test and take a graded quiz.

Almost everyone knows what’s good for their well-being, yet we can’t find the time to put it into our daily routines. We know that exercising is good, that meditation pays dividends, and that sleeping enough is essential for us to functional optimally. Yet, this knowledge does not always translate to action. This course attempts to bridge that gap through the creation of habits, by suggesting well-being practices that are practical, impactful, and research backed. As we know, we can’t just meditate on our well-being; there are other factors at play as well. This course therefore touches upon deep rooted behaviors that come in the way of our well-being and provides practical, everyday strategies to manage them. \n\nProfessionals seeking work-life balance and stress management techniques, young adults navigating transitions in life (college, career, relationships), parents juggling family responsibilities and personal well-being, individuals experiencing burnout or seeking to enhance their health, and anyone interested in developing healthier habits and enhancing their overall quality of life will find this course invaluable. Whether you're looking to refine existing self-care routines or establish new habits that support physical and mental well-being, this course provides practical strategies tailored to diverse life stages and challenges.\n\nParticipants should have an interest in personal development and an openness to learning new concepts and strategies. A willingness to implement self-care practices is essential for effectively applying the course's teachings. This course is designed to guide individuals through the process of habit formation and behavior change, focusing on cultivating habits that contribute to overall well-being and resilience.\n\nAfter completing this course, learners will be able to recognize the significance of habits in shaping their lives, explain the process of habit formation using evidence-based strategies, and apply effective techniques for cultivating habits that promote well-being, such as exercise, meditation, and gratitude practices. Participants will also gain skills in identifying and addressing common behaviors that impact well-being, such as comparing oneself to others and difficulty in setting boundaries, thus fostering a holistic approach to personal health and happiness.",

What kind of risks need to be considered ? \n\nMountains are recognized as particularly sensitive physical environments where intense and rapid changes have in the past, and may increasingly in the future, place pressure on their resource base. \n\nIn this context, a team of roughly 100 experts worked from 2008 to 2013 for the European ACQWA project (www.acqwa.ch) which was coordinated by the University of Geneva. The primary objectives of the project were to assess the impacts of a changing climate on the quantity and quality of water originating in mountain regions, particularly where snow- and ice melt represent a large, sometimes the largest, streamflow component. A further objective of the project was to determine the potential disruptions to water-dependent economic activities related to the climate impacts on hydrological systems, and to propose a portfolio of possible adaptation strategies.\n\nThis particular MOOC is inspired by the ACQWA Project and offers a better understanding of climate change, its impacts on the quality and quantity of water in mountain regions and the risks related to changing water resources. From an interdisciplinary perspective, the participation of twenty-five instructors from five different countries (Switzerland, England, South Korea, India and Nepal) and fourteen institutions (UNIGE, RTS, UNIFR, UZH, ETHZ, Meteodat GmbH, WGMS, Imperial College London, Agroscope, République et Canton de Genève, Yonsei University, IHCAP, ICIMOD, SDC, FOEN) highlights the diversity of both theoretical and practical viewpoints related to these issues.\n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able :\n\n- to define the general concept of climate change in mountain regions\n- to understand the concepts associated with climate change such as adaptation and water governance strategies\n- to consider the impacts of climate change on water resources in mountain regions\n- to identify the impacts of climate change on hydropower, agriculture, aquatic ecosystems and health \n- to enumerate risks that can occur in mountain areas and lead to disruptions in water availability and use.\n\nYour acquired knowledge will be evaluated through multiple-choice quizzes at the end of each unit of the course.\n\nThis MOOC on “Climate Change and Water in Mountain Regions : A Global Concern” was initiated and financed by the University of Geneva, through its Institute for Environmental Sciences. \n\nWe look forward to you joining us !",

While the EFE is concerned with the external factors by focusing on the opportunities and threats the organization is exposed to. The IFE-EFE matrix is created by assigning weight to each of the factors based on their perceived impact. Then the factors are ranked based on the company performance on each. The weighted score is determined by multiplying the weight by the ranks. Finally, the information on the overall scores of the IFE- EFE would reveal if the company meets the threshold to survive the competitiveness of the industry. \n\nTo demonstrate the application of the IFE-EFE matrix, we will use a spreadsheet to analyze a division of our energy services company together. The example of the case study would empower you to use the model to analyze your company or any other company of your choice. The project is for business leaders and entrepreneurs who want have a deep insight on how their internal and external factors determines their competitiveness.

This MOOC aims to train the next generation of business professionals and developers to acknowledge business’ interdependency with healthy landscapes and understand the value of ecosystem resources.\n\n“Historically, we have found countless ways to justify our continued exploitation of the environment: discovery, tradition, Manifest Destiny, even Chinese hoax. But we’re all out of excuses now. Each passing day swells the data on greenhouse gases and extreme weather, shrinking reservoirs and rising sea levels, and diminishing biodiversity. Our resources are finite, the window for change if not firmly shut, is certainly closing, and all life must adapt or be doomed.”\n\nTéa Obreht, \nThe New Yorker, Dec. 19&26, 2016, p. 106.\n\nIt is a frightening prospect indeed – that all life on Earth must either adapt or be doomed.

But this course is also about the solutions to this problem – business driven landscape restoration.\nSo rather than leaving you powerless with the prospect Obreht puts fowards above, it is our hope that you learn how you can be part of the solution to making sure that Planet Earth still provides a safe and habitable home for future generations. \nWe must act big and we must act now.\nWith this course we want to pass on valuable knowledge and teach you useful skills that you can apply in your professional life that will enable you to tackle the issue of landscape degradation and restoration. \nThe issue is urgent, so let’s dive right into it.\n\nThis MOOC is developed by the ENABLE partnership, which is co-funded by the ERASMUS+ programme of the European Commission and involves a diverse, international group of organizations including Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University, Commonland, United Nations University Land Restoration Training Programme, the Spanish National Research Council and Estoril Global Conferences.",

Many of these injuries are preventable with proper education and safety measures. By addressing common household hazards, we can significantly reduce the risk of injury and create a safer living environment for children. \n\nThe CHASE (Children’s Housing Assessment for a Safe Environment) protocol is a comprehensive tool designed to identify and mitigate injury risks in children’s homes. This course provides both families and health professionals with the knowledge and tools necessary to prevent common home injuries through a structured approach.  \n\nEach module covers a specific risk area, including carbon monoxide safety, falling furniture, fire safety, bathroom safety, window safety, stair safety, hot water safety, electrical safety, poison storage, and strangulation hazards. Assessors will learn about the risks, practical solutions, and engage in activities to ensure a safer living environment. \n\nEach module includes detailed training on assessing specific risks, using the CHASE tool effectively, and providing recommendations and interventions. Assessors will learn how to conduct thorough home inspections, provide educational materials, and facilitate necessary modifications to create safer homes for children. \n\nThe course emphasizes the importance of proactive measures and equips participants with knowledge and tools to safeguard their homes effectively.

        "description": "In humanitarian settings, mental ill-health is powerfully inter-connected with other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases. Integrating mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) with NCD prevention and care might therefore be useful, both to be more effective, and to require fewer resources. There is, however, a lack of widely accepted guidelines that take this into account, and this course is intended to draw attention to that issue.\n\nAttention to NCDs focused initially on four major disease categories (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and cancer) and four groups of associated risk factors (unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and harmful use of alcohol). Recently, mental ill-health has been considered as the fifth NCD and environmental determinant as the fifth risk factor for NCDs – known as ‘5-by-5’ conditions. \n\nThe course has a threefold aim: i) to explore evidence of interaction between mental ill-health and other NCDs and the role of psychosocial support in humanitarian response; ii) to explore what is being done and where; what level the determinants of health are being addressed at and the integration of mental health and psychosocial support or MHPSS and NCD prevention and care in humanitarian response; and iii) to identify and explore challenges, opportunities and lessons learned for integrating MHPSS and NCD prevention and care in humanitarian response.\n\nThe MOOC will be led by a course leader from the University of Copenhagen in close collaboration with academic teachers, the Danish Red Cross and IFRC Reference Centre for Psychosocial Support, Copenhagen, Denmark.",

You need a supply chain strategy to align with your customer needs, but you also need a good design to operationalize. You need a vision, but you also need robust processes that align well with the strategy. Not just that, you need enablers that can link strategy with design – which are digital tools. This course is unique because it allows you to reflect upon a firm's supply chain strategy and it's link with appropriate design (both fulfillment nodes such as manufacturing and warehousing, and  modes of transport such as shipping and trucking). Finally, it allows you to draw your own supply chain digital transformation canvas. The conceptual tools at appropriate places allow you to understand how to analyze the performance trade-offs, choose the right tools and decipher the mechanism that will enable you to decide the path to digitization.",

Desde sus orígenes en los años 50 del siglo XX, la UE ha expandido significativamente su influencia, y hoy enfrenta una nueva serie de desafíos globales, desde la gestión de la pandemia de COVID-19 hasta las recientes crisis energética y climática, y los efectos de la guerra en Ucrania. Estos desafíos han puesto de relieve la importancia de una respuesta coordinada a nivel europeo, impulsando el desarrollo de políticas comunes en áreas clave como la seguridad energética, la defensa común y la transición hacia una economía verde.\nA pesar de la creciente presión de posiciones críticas y escépticas frente al proceso de integración, la UE sigue siendo un referente crucial para sus ciudadanos. Así lo refleja, por ejemplo, el Eurobarómetro de 2023, en el cual un alto porcentaje de europeos expresó su apoyo a una mayor cooperación en áreas estratégicas como la política exterior, la sostenibilidad energética y la defensa de valores democráticos. Estas cifras resaltan el papel fundamental que la ciudadanía otorga a la UE en un contexto de globalización compleja y en continua transformación.\nFrente a las crecientes contradicciones de un mundo globalizado, entender cómo estos procesos de cesión progresiva de soberanía y coordinación de la toma de decisiones afectan a los ciudadanos europeos constituye uno de los retos más apasionantes para las ciencias políticas, las relaciones internacionales y el análisis de políticas públicas. Este curso, elaborado por la Cátedra Jean Monnet en Políticas Europeas de la UAB y cofinanciado por el Programa Erasmus+ de la UE, tiene como objetivo ofrecer una comprensión profunda del funcionamiento de la UE como un sistema político único. A través de un análisis crítico, el curso explora el origen y evolución de la UE, su diseño institucional y sus principales políticas públicas.\nDirigido a un público amplio, el curso proporciona herramientas para entender cómo se definen e implementan las políticas públicas a nivel europeo y doméstico, cuáles son sus actores principales, y las dinámicas que gobiernan la relación entre las instituciones de la UE y los Estados miembros.\nLos módulos están diseñados para ofrecer una visión integral del proceso de integración europea, partiendo de los hitos históricos más importantes, el rol de cada una de las principales instituciones de la UE y el impacto del derecho europeo en las legislaciones nacionales. Este curso combina la teoría con una perspectiva aplicada, seleccionando algunos de los ámbitos políticos más relevantes para observar la “UE en acción”, tanto a nivel interno (por ejemplo, economía, política agrícola, cohesión y política ambiental), como a nivel externo (la posición internacional de la UE, la cooperación al desarrollo y el comercio exterior, entre otros). Además, el curso analiza el papel de la UE en el contexto actual de tensiones internacionales y sus esfuerzos por fortalecer la seguridad y resiliencia europeas.\nPuedes ver el vídeo promocional del curso en este enlace: https://youtu.be/SnTonWSwuS8",

But there is great value in also seeing where crisis situations have not been handled well. In this course, we look at iconic cases, both well-managed and not well-managed, that point to lessons you may be able to use, especially if you are asked by a leader to assist them as they encounter a crisis. You'll also hear from experts in crisis management and crisis communication as they share with you what they have observed about these iconic cases. This course, however, offers another distinctive aspect: you'll hear about the warning signs of crises that will likely present future threats to organizations, with insights provided by an expert.

        "description": "This sequence of four courses will propose a multi-disciplinary approach to the study of Chinese cultural history conceived of as a succession of modes of rationality (philosophical, bureaucratic, and economic). The focus will be on the moments of paradigm shift from one mode of rationality to another. For each of these moments, cultural facts and artifacts—thought, literature, ritual—will be examined in relationship to changing social, political, and economic systems.\n\nThe first two courses will cover the periods of the Warring States (481-256 BCE) and the Period of Division (220-589 CE), with a brief excursion into the Han (206 BCE-220 CE). The Warring States laid the social and cultural foundations for the emergence of the imperial mode of rationality; the Period of Division saw the Buddhist “conquest” of China and the emergence of a rationality defined by the opposition of the Three Teachings to shamanism, that is, of a clear contrast between elite and popular culture.\n\nThe third and fourth courses will focus on the emergence of modern China in the Song-Yuan (960-1368) and of today’s China 1850 to the present. We will see how the modern attack on religion, redefined as \"superstition\", led not only to religious reform movements but also to a society in which science and the nation became the primary value systems promoted by the state.\n\nThe courses are listed below:\n\nA Critical Cultural History of China - Early China I: Intellectual Change in the Warring States and Han (481 BCE-220 CE)\nA Critical Cultural History of China - Early China II: Religious Transformation in the Period of Division (220-589 CE) \nA Critical Cultural History of China - Modern China I: Religion and Thought in the Song, Jin, and Yuan (960-1368) (To be launched in late 2018)\nA Critical Cultural History of China - Modern China II: Structuring Values (1850-2015) (To be launched in late 2018)",

You will learn to use Keras' functional API to create a multi output model which will be trained to learn two different labels given the same input example. The model will have one input but two outputs. A few of the shallow layers will be shared between the two outputs, you will also use a ResNet style skip connection in the model. If you are familiar with Keras, you have probably come across examples of models that are trained to perform multiple tasks. For example, an object detection model where a CNN is trained to find all class instances in the input images as well as give a regression output to localize the detected class instances in the input. Being able to use Keras' functional API is a first step towards building complex, multi-output models like object detection models.\n\nWe will be using TensorFlow as our machine learning framework. The project uses the Google Colab environment. You will need prior programming experience in Python. You will also need prior experience with Keras. Consider this to be an intermediate level Keras project. This is a practical, hands on guided project for learners who already have theoretical understanding of Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and optimization algorithms like gradient descent but want to understand how to use use Keras to write custom, more complex models than just plain sequential neural networks.\n\nNote: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

One way to deal with this is symbolic model checking: a way in which sets of states are represented symbolically. A fruitful way to do so is by representing sets of states by BDDs (binary decision diagrams).\nDefinitions and basic properties of BDDs are presented in this course, and the algorithms to compute them, as needed for doing CTL model checking.",

This is a course that will help you focus on the real difficulty in platform implementation, the structure of your business and its people. We will explore the benefits of low-code application development vs no-code development and how these tools are surpassing traditional development as the gold standard for custom applications. Our classes will showcase the low-code app development on the google platform and show you how to leverage LC/NC apis to leverage the functionality of tools like Zapier to connect your platform applications. All with little to no coding knowledge.\n\nThis fun and engaging course will take a foundational look at the necessary elements to successfully transform your business with the right platform. Starting with establishing a foundational understanding of LCNC tools and taking a look at the landscape of platforms in the market. Participants will get a taste of how citizen developers and professional developers can collaborate to build productive low-code applications. We will then introduce the four pillars model as a tool that will provide clarity for all of the critical elements that are involved in your implementation. We will also highlight some real world use cases where LC/NC applications have been built successfully and where application development has failed.\n\nHistorically, traditional implementation models utilize project management techniques to deliver solutions. Throw your PMBOK (project management body of knowledge) out the window. We are no longer running a project. Our platform is now a product and you are on the road to your digital transformation.",

        "description": "Из этого курса вы узнаете, как создавать успешные проекты по машинному обучению. Вы — лидер команды по внедрению ИИ или хотите им стать? Этот курс научит вас ставить правильные цели для своей команды.\n\n Многое из содержимого этого курса никогда не предлагалось в других образовательных проектах и наработано на основе моего опыта построения и внедрения многочисленных проектов. В настоящий курс также включены два тренажера, которые позволят вам отработать принятие решений в ходе организации проектов по машинному обучению. Тренажеры дадут вам опыт, на получение которого иначе могло бы потребоваться несколько лет работы в машинном обучении.\n\nПосле двух недель занятий вы: \n— поймете, как диагностировать ошибки в системах машинного обучения;\n— научитесь выделять наиболее перспективные направления для снижения количества ошибок;\n— получите знания о сложных настройках машинного обучения, таких как несоответствие наборов для обучения тестовым наборам, и сравнении показателей машины с показателями человеческого уровня;\n— узнаете, как применять сквозное обучение (end-to-end learning), перенос обучения (transfer learning) и многозадачное обучение (multi-task learning).\n\nЯ видел, как команды специалистов впустую тратили месяцы и даже годы работы потому, что не понимали принципы, излагаемые в этом курсе. Я надеюсь, что этот двухнедельный курс сэкономит месяцы вашего времени.\n\nОн независим от других, и для его прохождения нужны только базовые знания в области машинного обучения. Это третий курс специализации «Глубокое обучение».",

This Teach-Out is an invitation to think about what progress means, and how you can look for it wherever you are—in your city, community, or neighborhood—and reflect upon your own ideas about the place you live in.\n\nChanges in the built environment of our communities are themselves the result of human actions and intentions, such as municipal planning, commercial enterprises, or communities transforming their own space. In other words, in our cities we can see the results of our plans—our attempts to create and shape the future. Neighbors, political groups, corporations, governments, schools, and other organizations, they all shape the community, leaving traces that allow us to see in what directions they transformed our lives. \n\nThis Teach-Out will ask the following questions:\n•\tWhat are the forces that shape and change the places we inhabit? \n•\tHow do people connect with places in our modern cities? \n•\tDo places progress? \n•\tHow can we measure in them whether there is any “progress”? \n\nWe will interview a number of people who work in Atlanta, Georgia, but the questions and places we will see here are comparable to many of other places in the world on what it means to progress. In this Teach-Out you will learn how to find the history of public spaces in any community and how to reflect upon the idea of progress. Finally, you can join a conversation to discuss what has been explored, uncovered, and possibly transformed both within ourselves and our communities.\n\nA Teach-Out is: \n– an event – it takes place over a fixed, short period of time \n– an opportunity – it is open for free participation to everyone around the world \n– a community – it will be joined by a large number of diverse individuals \n– a conversation – an opportunity to give and take ideas and information from people \n\nThis community learning event invites participants from around the world to come together in conversation with the Emory campus community, including faculty experts. This Teach-Out is part of Emory’s commitment to engage the local and global community in exploring and understanding problems, events, and phenomena most important to our society. \n\nOriginating from University of Michigan (Teach-Out.org), Teach-Outs are short learning experiences focused on a specific current issue. Attendees will come together over a few days not only to learn about a subject or event but also to gain skills. Teach-Outs are open to the world and are designed to bring together individuals with wide-ranging perspectives in respectful and deep conversation. These events are an opportunity for diverse learners and a multitude of experts to come together to ask questions of one another and explore new solutions to the pressing concerns of our global community. Come, join the conversation!",

        "description": "This particular course entitled “Pipe Material Specification” under the specialization entitled “Design of Industrial Piping Systems”  is mainly aimed at piping system design aspects. The major differences between tube and pipe should be known to the designer first. The right selection of the straight pipe for a given process requirement is entirely based on the sound knowledge of the designer on pipe manufacturing techniques, pipe ends, pipe materials, and ASME B31 pressure piping series. Designers should be capable of determining the pipe wall thickness for the internal pressure as well as external pressure based on the ASME B31.3 code and selecting of proper schedule number from the ASME B36.10M  and B36.19M standards. Piping is composed of pipe fittings, valves, flanges, gaskets, nuts and bolts, etc. Therefore, designers should be acquainted with various types of fittings, importance, ends, pressure-temperature ratings, and material. Similarly, designers should be acquainted with various types of flanges, ends, face finishing, pressure-temperature ratings, materials, and similar knowledge on gaskets and nuts and bolting. Valves are used for isolation, regulation, and one-way operations. Therefore, types, end connections, material, pressure-temperature ratings,  internal construction, internal parts, and functioning of valves should be known to the designer for their right selection. PFDs, P&IDs, General Arrangement Drawings (GADs), and Piping Isometrics are important drawings for any process plant; and development, reading, and interpreting these drawings is one of the desired requirements that the designer should possess. To fulfill this requirement the designer should be thorough with certain symbols used to present a three-plane piping system on a 2D sheet such as GADs, etc. The designers must familiarize themselves with general abbreviations, service codes, line number identification, ‘insulation and heat tracing codes’, representations of pipelines, boundaries, off-page connectors, pipe fittings, piping valves, piping components, and ‘fire, and safety’. In a nutshell, the designer should be thorough with the legend sheet of a particular industry.\nThe flexibility of a piping system is a major issue and it is dicey if the piping system doesn’t have inherent flexibility. Therefore, designers should be masters in all aspects of pipe stress analysis and perform flexibility analysis using industry-accepted pipe stress analysis software. They should be in a position to suggest the optimum pipe routing with appropriate supports, hangers, and expansion joints. To become an expert in flexibility analysis the designer should be well familiar with various types of primary supports, secondary supports, various types of hangers, good practices followed in piping and equipment layout known as layout rules, and expansion joints. Further, it is a requirement expected from the designer, i.e., the design of jacketed piping.  Vibration-induced loads are to be included in the pipe flexibility analysis. Unless the designer knows the sources for pipe vibration and types; the effect of vibration cannot be captured in the stress analysis process. The piping system needs insulation and a thorough knowledge of the types, shapes, and materials is essential. Pipes may be routed through underground. Therefore, designers should be capable of making the decision when the underground piping is preferred. If preferred, the designer should know what sort of challenges going to be faced that arise from corrosion and land sliding, and what are remedial solutions.  Hence, designers should know about proper cathodic protection as it is one of the remedial solutions to prevent the UG pipe.\nThe course is aimed to address all these aspects and these essential topics are included in the course. These are explained and demonstrated in a lucid form therefore, the learners can easily grasp the concepts and acquire the required skillset as mentioned above.",

El liderazgo es circunstancial y para ello se requiere de capacidad y habilidades que permitan al líder evaluar las situaciones particulares y variar su estilo de liderazgo de acuerdo con ellas, es decir, no se debe permanecer estático.  \n\nRecorriendo este curso lograrás tener un criterio para reconocer los tipos de liderazgo y la importancia de la comunicación, su complejidad e influencia directa sobre los modelos mentales y las reacciones de las personas, pues la incorrecta descodificación de un mensaje resultará en un error o confusión posterior, que afectará el sentido de la comunicación. \n\nFinalmente, comprenderás que el líder actúa como formador, coach y propiciador de un clima de confianza donde quiera que sea llamado a actuar.",

Its applications range from solving Sudoku puzzles to arranging seating in a wedding banquet.  The same technology can schedule planes and their crews, coordinate the production of steel, and organize the transportation of iron ore from the mines to the ports. Good decisions on the use of scarce or expensive resources such as staffing and material resources also allow corporations to improve their profit by millions of dollars.  Similar problems also underpin much of our daily lives and are part of determining daily delivery routes for packages, making school timetables, and delivering power to our homes. Despite their fundamental importance, these problems are a nightmare to solve using traditional undergraduate computer science methods.\n\nThis course is intended for students who have completed Advanced Modelling for Discrete Optimization.  In this course, you will extend your understanding of how to solve challenging discrete optimization problems by learning more about the solving technologies that are used to solve them, and how a high-level model (written in MiniZinc) is transformed into a form that is executable by these underlying solvers. By better understanding the actual solving technology, you will both improve your modeling capabilities, and be able to choose the most appropriate solving technology to use.\n\nWatch the course promotional video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EiRsK-Rm08",

Customer centricity is important, but most organizations struggle to implement it properly. This is due to internal operations, processes, and most importantly, cost accounting systems.

The specialization provides an overview of devices, the physics background needed to understand the device operation, the construction of a device circuit model from a physical device model and a description of the device fabrication technology including packaging.\n\nThis second course provides a more detailed description of high-voltage Schottky and p-n diodes, starting with the semiconductor physics background needed to analyze both types of diodes. The main properties of crystalline semiconductors are presented that lead to the calculation of carrier densities and carrier currents, resulting in the drift-diffusion model for the semiconductors of interest. Next are a close look at Schottky diodes followed by p-n diodes, with a focus on the key figures of merit including the on-resistance, breakdown voltage and diode capacitance. For each diode, the analysis is then linked to the corresponding SPICE model. Finally, the power diode losses - both on-state losses and switching losses - are examined in a convertor circuit, including a comparison of silicon p-n diodes and 4H-SiC Schottky diodes.\n\nLearning objectives:\n•\tProvide students with a detailed understanding of High-Voltage Schottky and p-n diodes.\n•\tStudents will be able to calculate key diode parameters based on their physical structure.\n•\tStudents will be able to construct SPICE models for Schottky and p-n diodes.",

Les images nous servent à extraire des informations omniprésentes aujourd’hui. Elles doivent être systématiquement traitées pour s’affranchir des mauvaises conditions d’acquisition, afin d’isoler les objets pertinents et de les analyser.\n\nLes traitements présentés (filtrage , rehaussement, suppression du bruit) sont le point de départ de la chaîne d’analyse. Ils permettent par exemple le relevé des diagnostics en imagerie médicale, la détection de pièce défectueuse sur une ligne de production ou encore la reconnaissance des plaques d’immatriculation sur les radars.\n\nDans ce MOOC, vous prendrez connaissance des bases nécessaires en mathématiques et en informatique avec le langage Python. Vous apprendrez à manipuler les algorithmes et la programmation des opérations élémentaires du traitement d’images : charger et observer une image, analyser sa qualité, améliorer sa netteté et ses contrastes, ajouter du flou ou détecter des contours.\n\nPour suivre ce cours, des bases du langage de programmation Python sont nécessaires : boucles, opérateur logique, vectorisation des opérations , définition de fonction, tableaux et numpy.\n\nUne attestation de suivi avec succès est attribuée par Coursera aux apprenants réussissant à obtenir une note supérieure à 50 %.\n\nCe cours a été créé avec le soutien de la Fondation Patrick & Lina Drahi.",

        "description": "The objective of this course is to give students the most up-to-date information on the biological, personal, and societal relevance of sleep. Personal relevance is emphasized by the fact that the single best predictor of daytime performance is the quality of the previous night's sleep. The brain actively generates sleep, and the first section of the course is an overview of the neurobiological basis of sleep control. The course provides cellular-level understanding of how sleep deprivation, jet lag, and substances such as alcohol, ,caffeine, and nicotine alter sleep and wakefulness. The second section of the course covers sleep-dependent changes in physiology and sleep disorders medicine. Particular emphasis will be placed on disorders of excessive sleepiness, insomnia, and sleep-dependent changes in autonomic control. Chronic sleep deprivation impairs immune function and may promote obesity. Deaths due to all causes are most frequent between 4:00 and 6:00 a.m., and this second section of the class highlights the relevance of sleep for preventive medicine. The societal relevance of sleep will be considered in the final section of the class. In an increasingly complex and technologically oriented society, operator-error by one individual can have a disastrous negative impact on public health and safety.  Fatigue-related performance decrements are known to have contributed as causal factors to nuclear power plant failures, transportation disasters, and medical errors.",

This course will cover advanced topics in finding mutations lurking within DNA and proteins.\n\nIn the first half of the course, we would like to ask how an individual's genome differs from the \"reference genome\" of the species. Our goal is to take small fragments of DNA from the individual and \"map\" them to the reference genome.  We will see that the combinatorial pattern matching algorithms solving this problem are elegant and extremely efficient, requiring a surprisingly small amount of runtime and memory.\n\nIn the second half of the course, we will learn how to identify the function of a protein even if it has been bombarded by so many mutations compared to similar proteins with known functions that it has become barely recognizable.  This is the case, for example, in HIV studies, since the virus often mutates so quickly that researchers can struggle to study it.  The approach we will use is based on a powerful machine learning tool called a hidden Markov model.\n\nFinally, you will learn how to apply popular bioinformatics software tools applying hidden Markov models to compare a protein against a related family of proteins.",

The University has 47 700 students and 7 500 staff based in Lund, Sweden. Lund University unites tradition with a modern, dynamic, and highly international profile. With eight different faculties and numerous research centers and specialized institutes, Lund is the strongest research university in Sweden and one of Scandinavia's largest institutions for education and research. The university annually attracts a large number of international students and offers a wide range of courses and programmes taught in English. \n\nThe Faculty of Law is one of Lund University’s four original faculties, dating back to 1666. It is a modern faculty with an international profile, welcoming both international and Swedish students. Education, research and interaction with the surrounding community are the main focus of the Faculty’s work. The connection between the three is particularly apparent in the programmes and courses offered by the university, including the university’s MOOC course in European Business Law. The students get the chance to engross themselves in traditional legal studies, while interacting with both researchers and professionally active lawyers with qualifications and experience from various areas of law.\nThe faculty offers three international Masters: two 2-year Master’s programmes in International Human Rights Law and European Business Law, and a 1-year Master’s in European and International Tax Law. Students from around 40 countries take part in the programmes which offer a unique subject specialization within each field, with highly qualified researchers and professional legal practitioners engaged in the teaching. \n\nThe Master’s programme in European Business Law provides an in-depth understanding of both the practical and the theoretical aspects of business law within the European Union. The programme provides both general and specific knowledge of the European Union legal framework, which is necessary for students intending to work as legal advisors or business decision-makers. The programme is delivered in English and is open to students with at least a three year degree in Law (Bachelor, LL.B, or equivalent) who want to specialise in European economic and business law.\n\nThe MOOC course in European Business Law is a great course to start with for students intending to apply for the Master’s programme in European Business Law. Even though the MOOC course does not grant credits previous knowledge of the subject is considered upon admission to the master’s programme.

Now, we must realize its systemic nature, in all sectors and the role of each organization in its deployment.\n\nTo clarify your thoughts, we have met 3 companies, from various sectors, who are very committed to the subject. They will share with you their journey to transform their business model into a circular one. We will also meet some start-ups, SMEs and actors of the social and solidarity economy, to better understand the role and necessary cooperation between those actors to move from a linear to a circular economy.\n\nWe have made this MOOC with the consultancy agency in strategy Circulab, which helps organisations to create circular and regenerative solutions.

Abhängig von Ihrem Zeitplan können Sie sich die Videos über einige Wochen hinweg ansehen oder alle sofort ansehen. Ein Kursteilnehmer, der sich gleich alles angesehen hatte, kam zu dem Schluss, dass „es so gut sei wie Breaking Bad“. Ein anderer Kursteilnehmer verglich den Kurs mit „House of Cards“.  In beiden Serien gibt es interessante Beispiele für komplexe Verhandlungen!\n\n(2) Testen Sie Ihre Verhandlungsfähigkeiten, indem Sie die Verhandlung in Modul 6 abschließen. Sie können mit einem Freund vor Ort verhandeln oder mithilfe von „Diskussionen“ einen Partner aus einem anderen Teil der Welt finden. Ihr Verhandlungspartner gibt Ihnen Feedback zu Ihren Verhandlungsfähigkeiten. Um Sie bei Ihren Verhandlungen zu unterstützen, habe ich mehrere kostenlose Verhandlungsplanungstools entwickelt, die sich auf den Kurs beziehen.  Diese Tools und eine kostenlose App sind unter http://negotiationplanner.com/ verfügbar. \n\n(3) Legen Sie die Abschlussprüfung ab.

The course discusses the many changes which occur in people’s lives when they are uprooted by a disaster, ranging from changes in disease patterns, access to health care, livelihoods, shelter, sanitary conditions, nutritional status, etceteras. We will explore what humanitarian interventions could look like if we want to mitigate the effects of disasters. The course content is a mix of theoretical knowledge and many practical examples from recent disasters. We think this course is unique because it contains so many practical ‘real-life’ examples and is taught by instructors and guest lecturers who together have over 200 years of experience in this field. \n\nThe course consists of 10 modules totaling approximately 9-10 hours of delivered content with an additional 2-3 hours of self-work (quizzes and writing and evaluating a short peer-review assignment) as well as lively discussions forums. The course has been designed in a way that each module builds on the lessons of previous modules. However, you may do the modules in any order and some can be done separately. \n\nYou do not have to pay for this course if you choose to enroll without a certificate. Sometimes referred to as auditing, enrolling without a certificate means that you will have access to all of the videos, quizzes, assignments, and discussions. The only difference is that you will not receive a certificate upon completion. Click the Enroll Without a Certificate link to sign up and begin the course. Even if you enroll in a session that has yet to begin, you may access most of the course materials right away by clicking the Preview Course Materials link. However, you will have to wait for the session to begin before posting your comments on the discussion forum or accessing the final peer-reviewed assessment. Visit the Learner Help Center for details about session schedules.\n\nIf you want to learn more, there is a second course which follows this one entitled, Public Health in Humanitarian Crises 2. We welcome you to take this. The course has a similar set-up and discusses additional topics, such as infectious disease outbreaks, disease epidemiology, maternal and newborn health, mental health, humanitarian project design, humanitarian principles, and many other topics.",

Use your own experience to categorise the processes and activities involved in learning and transferring that learning into practice. There are many criteria against which the success of training and development activities can be judged. One of the most important, however, is learning transfer. Ultimately, the success of any given training and/or development program is reflected in whether or not what is learned is applied on the job. Organisations - and indeed trainees themselves - invest large amounts of time, effort, and resources in work-related training and generally expect to see this manifested in some way back in the work setting (e.g. as observable changes to how work is conducted). However, many organisations and their people view the likelihood of transfer of training more in hope than expectation.

        "description": "Dinosaurs are unique in the history of life. They evolved more than 200 million years ago, inhabited every continent, and are still around today. This course provides an overview of the world of dinosaurs, from the earliest small dinosaurs to titanosaurs and T. rex to modern birds, and investigates some of the most fascinating questions in dinosaur paleontology: How did dinosaurs get so big? What were they like when they were alive? Why did they suddenly go extinct? Drawing on the Museum’s long-standing leadership in the field, including the world's largest collection of vertebrate fossils, renowned paleontologists Mark Norell and Diego Pol, joined by colleagues from around the world, explain how modern discoveries are made. Through videos and essays, this course takes learners into the field, where fossils are discovered and excavated, and then back to the lab where paleontologists use new technologies and methods to infer how these animals lived. Learners will do their own investigations using real specimens to gain first-hand knowledge of how paleontologists continue to make new discoveries about ancient creatures.",

        "description": "Bias in healthcare delivery leads to worse patient care and patient outcomes. Advancing Health Equity: A Guide for Reducing Bias in Healthcare provides you an interactive bias training that teaches skills applicable to addressing enhanced public health guidelines and approaching the work of health equity.  \n\nThe racial and ethnic makeup of the United States is constantly shifting, and more specifically, becoming more diverse. Such changes require a more health equity-focused workforce and health equity-minded leadership. Bias training plays an essential role in leadership development, and it’s become imperative for all healthcare workers to recognize the foundational connection between biases and health care management and policy.\n\nThis course is designed to challenge your awareness, values, and actions on implicit and unconscious bias, and is intended to guide individuals hoping to contribute to this work in a healthcare context. The following core concepts form the basis of instruction and together offer an introductory perspective on this pressing topic: 1.) Community Orientation; 2.) Organizational Awareness; 3.) Professionalism; 4.) Accountability, Change Leadership, and Strategic Orientation. \n\nAn interactive 360-video experience allows you to engage in healthcare situations that center bias on multiple levels of our healthcare delivery systems.  You will be prompted to consider multiple perspectives and roles, and use empathy to analyze bias and take action.",

This course will help you learn about the role that ethical, moral, and cultural principles play when lawmakers and public officials formulate and execute public policy.  \n\nThis course draws upon classical writings in political theory and contemporary cases on ethical dilemmas in public policymaking. It will enable you to debate various ethics themes such as justice, equality, fairness, individual liberty, free enterprise, charity, human rights, and minimising harm to others. It will also help you grasp how these themes integrate into various decision-making models, such as the utilitarian approach, fairness and justice approach, and rights approach. This course will help you examine these models in a real-life context to help balance competing interests to make the best decision.  \n\nIn this course, you will gain an in-depth understanding of the challenges that stand at the crossroads between moral and practical decision-making as a real-life practitioner. You will find answers to questions such as if tolerance is a virtue in public policies that risk challenging constitutional norms, what could be the ethical implications of state violence in the name of national interest, and if it would be a good ethical policy to building dams to generate electricity for more people by displacing the inhabitants of that area. With the help of case studies, this course will help you dive deep into the dilemmas faced by the policymakers (both elected and appointed).

        "description": "Agile provides greater opportunities for control and risk management and offers unique benefits that traditional methods miss. As a project manager or program manager the emphasis should always be on delivering value and benefits. With complex projects these demand increase and knowing you've delivered value can be difficult for even those with years of project management experience.\n\nHowever, in this course we'll cover the agile practices and management skills necessary to delivery value with certainty, such as:\n\n1. Transparency with daily standup meetings discussing work status, risk, and pace.\n\n2. How a clear definition of done drives acceptance by all key stakeholders.\n\n3. Measuring performance and benefits of working solutions during project delivery.\n\n4. Iteratively testing to gain authentic feedback on solution requirements and stability.\n\n5. Regular retrospectives that drive continuous improvement into the team.\n\n6. How agile project management ensures success and uniquely tackles business risk\n\n7. Quality management principles to reduce project risk and technical debt\n\n8. Manage and reduce interdependencies between project teams to scale programs at speed\n\n9. Making the business case for agile contracts and how they ensure deliverables achieve business outcomes and objectives\n\nIn this course, you will learn how these levers of control far exceed traditional management methods of earned value management (EVM), which relies on estimates and no changes in scope. We'll discuss how the key to unlocking the control potential is to learn what to manage, and how to measure it. It's no longer just ensure the deliverables are delivered on-time and under-budget.\n\nThis shift to benefits management is in-line with how the PMBOK is changing to integrate program management concerns into project management with an emphasis on value and not just delivery of scope specifications. The Agile revolution requires program managers to embrace this type of continuing education to advance and grow in your project management career.\n\nSo how do programs ensure smooth project delivery?\n\nThis answer is bottoms-up with different controls at each level of management, separating the concerns between the program, the individual projects, and the team processes. For teams, it’s a focus on team velocity and how to ensure its measurement is useful for diagnosing internal and external productivity constraints. For the project, the focus is on how to integrate teams of teams on related projects and ensure stead delivery of product roadmaps. For the program, the focus is on what capabilities are delivered and how to measure return on investment (ROI) capabilities provide. This also requires understanding your portfolio and contracting processes.\n\nWhile this course will not make you an agile certified practitioner (PMI-ACP), or certified scrum master (CSM), it offers a more fundamental agile certification based on agile principles and how agile leadership is applied in industry today. You'll finish this course more than ready to continue your agile journey, which we hope either completes your certificate with us or takes you to one of our most popular courses in the series, \"Agile Leadership Principles and Practices.\"\n\nUpon successful completion of this course, learners can earn 10 Professional Development Unit (PDU) credits, which are recognized by the Project Management Institute (PMI). PDU credits are essential to those looking to maintain certification as a Project Management Professional (PMP).",

Well, there are some particular considerations for every data set, and public health data sets have particular features that need special attention. In a word, they're messy. Like the others in the series, this is a hands-on course, giving you plenty of practice with R on real-life, messy data, with predicting who has diabetes from a set of patient characteristics as the worked example for this course. Additionally, the interpretation of the outputs from the regression model can differ depending on the perspective that you take, and public health doesn’t just take the perspective of an individual patient but must also consider the population angle. That said, much of what is covered in this course is true for logistic regression when applied to any data set, so you will be able to apply the principles of this course to logistic regression more broadly too. \n\nBy the end of this course, you will be able to: \nExplain when it is valid to use logistic regression \nDefine odds and odds ratios \nRun simple and multiple logistic regression analysis in R and interpret the output \nEvaluate the model assumptions for multiple logistic regression in R \nDescribe and compare some common ways to choose a multiple regression model \n\nThis course builds on skills such as hypothesis testing, p values, and how to use R, which are covered in the first two courses of the Statistics for Public Health specialisation. If you are unfamiliar with these skills, we suggest you review Statistical Thinking for Public Health and Linear Regression for Public Health before beginning this course. If you are already familiar with these skills, we are confident that you will enjoy furthering your knowledge and skills in Statistics for Public Health: Logistic Regression for Public Health. \n\nWe hope you enjoy the course!",

But “under the hood,” your brain must figure out even the simplest of details about the world around you and your position in it.  Recognizing your mother, finding your phone, going to the grocery store, playing the banjo – these require careful sleuthing and coordination across different sensory and motor domains.  This course traces the brain’s detective work to create this sense of space and argues that the brain’s spatial focus permeates our cognitive abilities, affecting the way we think and remember.\n\nThe material in this course is based on a book I've written for a general audience.  The book is called \"Making Space: How the Brain Knows Where Things Are\", and is available from Amazon, Barnes and Noble, or directly from Harvard University Press. \n\nThe course material overlaps with classes on perception or systems neuroscience, and can be taken either before or after such classes.\n\nDr. Jennifer M. Groh, Ph.D.\nProfessor\nPsychology & Neuroscience; Neurobiology\nDuke University\n www.duke.edu/~jmgroh\n\nJennifer M. Groh is interested in how the brain process spatial information in different sensory systems, and how the brain's spatial codes influence other aspects of cognition.  She is the author of a recent book entitled \"Making Space:  How the Brain Knows Where Things Are\" (Harvard University Press, fall 2014).\n\nMuch of her research concerns differences in how the visual and auditory systems encode location, and how vision influences hearing.  Her laboratory has demonstrated that neurons in auditory brain regions are sometimes responsive not just to what we hear but also to what direction we are looking and what visual stimuli we can see.  These surprising findings challenge the prevailing assumption that the brain’s sensory pathways remain separate and distinct from each other at early stages, and suggest a mechanism for such multi-sensory interactions as lip-reading and ventriloquism (the capture of perceived sound location by a plausible nearby visual stimulus).\n\nDr. Groh has been a professor at Duke University since 2006.  She received her undergraduate degree in biology from Princeton University in 1988 before studying neuroscience at the University of Michigan (Master’s, 1990), the University of Pennsylvania (Ph.D., 1993), and Stanford University (postdoctoral, 1994-1997).  Dr. Groh has been teaching undergraduate classes on the neural basis of perception and memory for over fifteen years.  She is presently a faculty member at the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience and the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences at Duke University.  She also holds appointments in the Departments of Neurobiology and Psychology & Neuroscience at Duke.\n\nDr. Groh’s research has been supported by a variety of sources including the John S. Guggenheim Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research Young Investigator Program, the McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience, the John Merck Scholars Program, the EJLB Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Whitehall Foundation, and the National Organization for Hearing Research.",

        "description": "Essentials of Global Health is a comprehensive introduction to global health. It is meant to introduce you to this topic in well-structured, clear and easy to understand ways. Much of the course will focus on five questions: What do people get sick, disabled and die from; Why do they suffer from these conditions? Which people are most affected? Why should we care about such concerns? What can be done to address key health issues, hopefully at least cost, as fast as possible, and in sustainable ways?  The course will be global in coverage but with a focus on low- and middle-income countries, the health of the poor, and health disparities. Particular attention will be paid throughout the course to health systems issues, the linkages between health and development, and health matters related to global interdependence. The course will cover key concepts and frameworks but be practical in orientation.\n\nESSENTIALS OF GLOBAL HEALTH WAS PRODUCED IN PART DUE TO THE GENEROUS FUNDING OF THE DAVID F. SWENSEN FUND FOR INNOVATION IN TEACHING.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCourse Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of the course, learners should be able to:\n\n•\tArticulate key public health concepts related to global health;\n•\tAnalyze the key issues in global health from a number of perspectives;\t\n•\tDiscuss with confidence the burden of disease in various regions of the world; how it varies by sex, age, and location; key risk factors for this burden; and how the disease burden can be addressed in cost-effective ways;\n•\tAssess key health disparities, especially as they relate to the health of low-income and marginalized people in low- and middle-income countries; \n•\tOutline the key actors and organizations in global health and the manner in which they cooperate to address critical global health concerns;\n•\tReview key global health challenges that are likely to arise in the coming decades.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nValue Added of the Course\n\nThe course seeks to add special value by being comprehensive, by handling each  topic in a consistent framework, and by helping learners gain an understanding of well grounded approaches to assessing global health issues and what can be done to address them.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Readings and other materials for Essentials of Global Health\n\nFor almost every session of Essentials of Global Health, you will see: \n\n- Required readings\n- Recommended readings\n- Recommended videos\n\nWe have selected a small number of readings for each session that are central to understanding the content of the session. We have put these under “required readings”.\n\nFor each required reading, we have also indicated how carefully you should read the material and on what parts of the material you should focus your attention.\n\nIn addition, we have selected some additional readings that would be very helpful to your understanding the content of each session. \n\nThe first is a textbook, Global Health 101, third edition. This is a comprehensive introductory textbook that closely follows the content of this Essentials of Global Health course. We have indicated for each session what part of the book you should read. Using this textbook can be very valuable to your mastering the content of the course.\n\nThe second set of “recommended readings” is some additional readings, mostly from journal articles and reports. For these, too, we have indicated how carefully you should read the material and on what parts of the material you should focus your attention.\n\nLearners should note that to access articles from The Lancet they will have to register with the Lancet, if they do not have online access to a library that has The Lancet. Once they are registered, they will be able to sign into The Lancet and access all of its free articles.\n\nWe have also indicated for most sessions one or two videos that relate to the topic of the session. These are meant to help the learner get a better feel for the topic which is being covered. Most learners will find the videos brief, easy and enjoyable to watch, and very enlightening.",

Whether you are a full-time student, have a full-time job, a family to take care of or all of the above, you can do it. Really! And I will help you get there.\n\nIn this Course, you will write your first novel. Many people say they have often thought about writing a novel and are planning to do it someday, but very few ever actually do. However, in this course, you will do it. You will learn how to form a basic idea, any idea, into a structure and discipline that will allow you to create, write and complete a fully-realized novel ready to submit for publication. \n\nIf you have any concerns regarding the protection of your original work, Coursera's privacy policy protects the learner's IP and you are indeed the sole owners of your work. \n\nHere is a link to a trailer for the course. To view the trailer, please copy and paste the link into your browser.\nhttps://vimeo.com/385761391/c5e7f873cf\n\nLearner review: \"It was a great experience, I really enjoyed it.\"\n\nIn Write Your First Novel, you’ll learn to break down your creative endeavor into components and you’ll discover a process that will allow you to do what few have done: produce and complete a full-length work of fiction in the form of a 50,000-word novel. \n\nLearner Review: \"You teach storytelling like no other teacher. I cannot put in words how much I appreciate it. This daily writing, and the product that comes with it, have been a great mental support during the pandemic time. Art is a support for life, as Stephen King said, and thanks to you I experienced it first-hand during this time. I think I will keep writing 500 words per night for the rest of my life. I owe it to you. You taught me how to write a novel, and it works every time.  Huge thanks, and wishing you all the best.\"\n\nI am a proponent of experiential learning (also known as active learning). My lectures are short and to the point, designed in a step-by-step process essential to your success as a writer. I will guide you, I will show you how to get there, hopefully I will inspire you. You will learn through your own activity - which is writing! I firmly believe that the only way to become a writer is to write, write, write! \n \nLearner review:  \"As a published author, I took this course to relearn the skills. I thoroughly enjoyed each and every lecture and quiz. This course was very, very helpful and the videos were very well executed. Cheers!\"\n\nWriting fiction is a truly beautiful thing. Putting your own words on a page to tell a story which enters your readers minds and allows them to share the thoughts, emotions and lives of your characters is a very satisfying, rewarding experience.\n\nLearner review: \"BEST TEACHER EVER!

Quelles en sont les différentes expressions ? Les démocraties et leurs expressions courantes ne suffisent-elles pas à répondre aux problèmes écologiques ? Et si ce n’est pas le cas, quels sont les apports éventuels et potentiels de l’écologie politique ? Ce cours se propose à répondre à ces questions, l’objectif global étant de comprendre les tenants et aboutissants de l’interface écologie et politique.\n\n\nObjectifs pédagogiques du cours :\n\n1.\tSituer dans l’histoire des idées et de la société ce qu’on entend par écologie politique\n2.\tMaîtriser le lexique de l’écologie et de l’écologie politique\n3.\tAnalyser le caractère alternatif des courants de l’écologie politique en se situant dans le mouvement des idées et non sur la scène politicienne\n4.\tIdentifier les différents courants et leurs approches\n5.\tSituer de manière critique les réponses que propose l’écologie politique aux difficultés qu’elle pointe\n6.

        "description": "For several decades now, assessment has become an increasingly pressing educational priority. Teacher and school accountability systems have come to be based on analysis of large-scale, standardized summative assessments. As a consequence, assessment now dominates most conversations about reform, particularly as a measure of teacher and school accountability for learner performance. Behind the often heated and at times ideologically gridlocked debate is a genuine challenge to address gaps in achievement between different demographically identifiable groups of students. There is an urgent need to lift whole communities and cohorts of students out of cycles of underachievement. For better or for worse, testing and public reporting of achievement is seen to be one of the few tools capable of clearly informing public policy makers and communities alike about how their resources are being used to expand the life opportunities for their children. This course is an overview of current debates about testing, and analyses the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of approaches to assessment. The course also focuses on the use of assessment technologies in learning. It will explore recent advances in computer adaptive and diagnostic testing, the use of natural language processing technologies in assessments, and embedded formative assessments in digital and online curricula. Other topics include the use of data mining, learning analytics and artificial intelligence in learning management systems and educational technology platforms. Participants will be required to consider issues of data access, privacy and the challenges raised by ‘big data’ including data persistency and student profiling.\n\n--------------------------------\nRecommended Background\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course is designed for people interested in the future of education and the \"learning society,\" including people who may wish to join education as a profession, practicing teachers interested in exploring future directions for a vocation that is currently undergoing transformation, and community and workplace leaders who regard their mission to be in part \"educative.\"\n\n--------------------------------\nRelated Resources\n--------------------------------\n\nOnline resources are available here:\nhttps://newlearningonline.com\n\n--------------------------------\nJoin our Online Communities!\n--------------------------------\n\nCGScholar (Create an account and join the New Learning community)\nhttps://cgscholar.com/community/community_profiles/new-learning/community_updates\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/newlearningonline\n\nTwitter\nhttps://twitter.com/neolearning\n\n--------------------------------\nTake this Course for Credit at the University of Illinois\n--------------------------------\n\nThis course has the same content and anticipates the same level of contribution by students in the Assessment for Learning course offered to graduate certificate, masters, and doctoral level students in the Learning Design and Leadership Program in the College of Education at the University of Illinois.\n\nOf course, in the nature of MOOCs many people will just want to view the videos and casually join some of the discussions.

We will analyze both categorical data and quantitative data, starting with one population techniques and expanding to handle comparisons of two populations. We will learn how to construct confidence intervals. We will also use sample data to assess whether or not a theory about the value of a parameter is consistent with the data. A major focus will be on interpreting inferential results appropriately.  \n\nAt the end of each week, learners will apply what they’ve learned using Python within the course environment. During these lab-based sessions, learners will work through tutorials focusing on specific case studies to help solidify the week’s statistical concepts, which will include further deep dives into Python libraries including Statsmodels, Pandas, and Seaborn.

The Bible refers to its gods, rulers, and pyramids. Neighboring cultures in the ancient Near East and Mediterranean wrote about its god-like kings and its seemingly endless supply of gold.  The Greeks and Romans describe aspects of Egypt's culture and history.\n\nAs the 19th century began, the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt highlighted the wonders of this ancient land, and public interest soared.  Not long after, Champollion deciphered Egypt's hieroglyphs and paved the way for other scholars to reveal that Egyptian texts dealt with medicine, dentistry, veterinary practices, mathematics, literature, and accounting, and many other topics. Then, early in the 20th century, Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun and its fabulous contents. Exhibitions of this treasure a few decades later resulted in the world's first blockbuster, and its revival in the 21st century has kept interest alive.\n\nJoin Dr. David Silverman, Professor of Egyptology at Penn, Curator in Charge of the Egyptian Section of the Penn Museum, and curator of the Tutankhamun exhibitions  on a guided tour of the mysteries and wonders of this ancient land.  He has developed this online course and set it in the galleries of the world famous Penn Museum.  He uses many original Egyptian artifacts to illustrate his lectures as he guides students as they make their own discovery of this fascinating culture.",

Il en présente les sources, les catégories, le contenu et les limites qui leur sont opposables, ainsi que les obligations qu’ils génèrent à la charge des Etats. Il expose aussi les principaux mécanismes de mise en œuvre prévus au niveau universel et régional pour assurer leur respect. \n\nDepuis la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, les droits de l’homme sont un domaine en plein essor. De nombreuses causes sont aujourd’hui défendues et débattues sous la bannière des droits de l’homme : la protection des minorités, la lutte contre la discrimination des femmes, des personnes lesbiennes, gaies, bisexuelles et transgenres (LGBT), la lutte contre la torture et les disparitions forcées, la lutte contre la pauvreté ou encore la protection de l’environnement et la protection des données. Partout dans le monde, ces causes mobilisent tant les acteurs politiques que la société civile et elles sont discutées dans de multiples enceintes, nationales et internationales.\n\nLe présent cours vise à offrir les bases nécessaires pour appréhender et comprendre le domaine vaste et complexe que sont devenus les droits de l’homme. Quelles sont les caractéristiques et les différentes catégorie des droits de l’homme ? Quels sont leurs fondements philosophiques et historiques ? Pourquoi ces droits sont-ils importants ? Quels instruments visent à les protéger ? Comment rendre ces droits opérationnels ? Quels mécanismes existent pour les mettre en œuvre et quels sont leurs avantages et leurs inconvénients ?\n\nEn abordant ces questions, le cours s’adresse tant à des membres de la communauté universitaire qu’à des praticiens (responsables politiques, membres du corps diplomatique, fonctionnaires, journalistes, membres d’ONG, défenseurs des droits de l’homme et spécialistes de la coopération au développement, de l’aide humanitaire et des questions relatives aux réfugiés), ainsi qu’à toutes les personnes qui sont engagées dans la protection des droits de l’homme ou simplement désireuses de mieux comprendre ce phénomène.\n\nLe cours est conçu et dispensé par les Professeurs Maya Hertig Randall et Michel Hottelier, de la Faculté de droit de l’Université de Genève. Durant le cours, des membres d’organes et institutions voués à la protection des droits de l’homme et des spécialistes de la communauté académique seront invités à intervenir.\n\nLe cours est donné en français.

        "description": "Todas las regiones del mundo se enfrentan a vulnerabilidades concretas ante el cambio climático y tienen diversas oportunidades de mitigar los efectos y aumentar su resiliencia en el siglo XXI. La comunidad internacional ha expresado su intención de actuar al respecto mediante el Acuerdo de París en la 21ª Conferencia de las Partes en la Convención Marco de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Cambio Climático. De hecho, décadas de avances en desarrollo se ven amenazadas si no se adoptan medidas contra el cambio climático, lo que significa que nos encontramos en un momento de «ahora o nunca». Este curso presenta las pruebas científicas más recientes sobre el cambio climático, explica los distintos efectos de alcance regional y difunde estrategias de acción contra el cambio climático, así como oportunidades para que pueda tomar medidas en relación con el cambio climático.\n\nAcerca del curso\n\nEste MOOC orientado a la acción le brindará la oportunidad de conocer los efectos del cambio climático a escala regional y las estrategias sectoriales específicas utilizadas para aumentar la resiliencia y avanzar hacia un futuro con bajas emisiones de carbono. Tendrá la oportunidad de estudiar a fondo estas cuestiones y adaptar su experiencia de aprendizaje a una o varias de las siguientes regiones:\n\n•\tAmérica Latina y el Caribe\n•\tÁfrica Subsahariana\n•\tOriente Medio y Norte de África\n•\tEuropa Oriental y Asia Central\n•\tAsia Oriental y el Pacífico\n•\tAsia Meridional\n\nPara ello el MOOC reúne a reconocidos científicos y responsables políticos que ofrecerán un resumen de las últimas pruebas científicas sobre el cambio climático, estrategias de desarrollo con bajas emisiones de carbono y capacidad de adaptación al cambio climático a escala regional entre sectores, así como un análisis del Acuerdo de París y otros de los resultados de la 21ª Conferencia de las Partes.\nPrograma del curso\n\nDescripción \n\nBajemos la temperatura: La ciencia climática pasa a la acción se divide en cuatro semanas. En las primeras dos semanas se presentará una visión global de las pruebas científicas del cambio climático, que irá seguida de perspectivas específicas de cada región sobre los efectos de un aumento de la temperatura en el mundo en el siglo XXI. Las últimas dos semanas se centrarán en las estrategias de acción emprendidas en distintas regiones y países para abordar el desafío climático, y sobre cómo puede actuar la población de manera individual.\n\nSemana 1:  El cambio climático en el siglo XXI\n\n•\tCambios históricos y previstos observados en el sistema climático en los últimos años del siglo XXI.\n•\tEl potencial de contribución prevista determinada a nivel nacional (CPDN) presentada en la 21ª Conferencia de las Partes por parte de 187 países para inducir a la acción climática.\n•\tTendencias de los efectos del cambio climático, entre otros la pérdida de la capa de hielo del Ártico, el deshielo de los glaciares, el aumento de las olas de calor y las temperaturas extremas, la sequía y la aridez. \n•\tLas posibles respuestas de los sistemas naturales, explicando cómo el calentamiento podría dar lugar al aumento del nivel del mar, a olas de calor y temperaturas extremas, y a la acidificación de los océanos.\n\nSemana 2: Efectos de alcance sectorial y regional\n\n•\tRepercusiones en sectores clave del desarrollo —desde el calentamiento por encima de la temperatura de la época preindustrial y tendencias climáticas previstas— en cada una de las regiones del mundo.\n•\tRepercusiones sectoriales centradas en la producción agrícola, los recursos hídricos, los servicios de los ecosistemas y la vulnerabilidad de las zonas costeras para las poblaciones afectadas. \n•\tImportancia de los riesgos que pueden invertir los logros de desarrollo obtenidos con tanto esfuerzo y atrapar en la pobreza a millones de personas, ilustrando la necesidad de actuar ya con urgencia.\n\nSemana 3: La ciencia climática pasa a la acción en materia de cambio climático\n\n•\tDebates sobre regiones específicas en torno a las acciones de mitigación necesarias para reducir las emisiones a la vez que se disminuye la vulnerabilidad ante los efectos del cambio climático por medio de la adaptación y el aumento de la resiliencia al clima.\n•\tPerspectivas de expertos regionales sobre sus experiencias con estrategias y acciones propuestas en cada región para contribuir a la transición hacia una senda de desarrollo con bajas emisiones y resiliente al clima. \n\nSemana 4: Qué puede hacer\n\n•\tEfecto transformador de los cambios diarios a escala mundial\n•\tLa razón de actuar ahora, actuar juntos y actuar de un modo diferente\n•\tEjemplos y beneficios esperados de las políticas de mitigación y adaptación, teniendo en cuenta las contribuciones a las reducciones de las emisiones a escala mundial y las oportunidades de desarrollo a escala local\n\nAparte de los principales recursos y asignaciones, podrá optar por aprovechar aún más el curso participando en ejercicios divertidos opcionales, interconexiones y debates, y sumergiéndose a fondo en nuestra rica selección de recursos complementarios.

        "description": "In their ambition to capture “real life,” Japanese painters, poets, novelists and photographers of the nineteenth century collaborated in ways seldom explored by their European contemporaries. This course offers learners the chance to encounter and appreciate behavior, moral standards and some of the material conditions surrounding Japanese artists in the nineteenth century, in order to renew our assumptions about what artistic “realism” is and what it meant.\n\nLearners will walk away with a clear understanding of how society and the individual were conceived of and represented in early modern Japan. Unlike contemporary western art forms, which acknowledge their common debt as “sister arts” but remain divided by genre and discourse, Japanese visual and literary culture tended to combine, producing literary texts inspired by visual images, and visual images which would then be inscribed with poems and prose. Noticing and being able to interpret this indivisibility of visual/literary cultures is essential in understanding the social and psychological values embedded within the beauty of Japanese art.",

Por esto, es crítico que el clínico y especialista tengan una sólida formación en estas áreas para poder comprender y analizar críticamente todas aquellas estrategias encaminadas a formar parte de su vida profesional. \n\nEn este curso, nos enfocaremos a dos de las enfermedades más comunes que afectan a la cavidad bucal, la caries dental y la enfermedad periodontal.\n\nEn la primera sección, hablaremos sobre la bioquímica de la caries dental y como esta es resultado del fenómeno de transición de la disbiósis de la película. Esto lo correlacionaremos con los fenómenos de remineralización dental, así como con el flúor y su relación con la salud dental.\n\nPosteriormente hablaremos sobre la biología de la enfermedad periodontal. Veremos cómo los cambios en el ecosistema bucal conducen a los cambios inflamatorios, que perpetúan los estados de gingivitis y enfermedad periodontal.\n\nAsimismo, describiremos cuáles son los cambios celulares que se van dando durante esa transición.\n\nFinalmente, hablaremos sobre la relación de la cavidad bucal con las enfermedades sistémicas.",

These tools will then be used to model and analyze portfolio choices: first, learners will study the so-called canonical portfolio problem, that is, the problem of an investor who has to choose how to allocate their wealth between a safe and a risky asset; then, they will study portfolio choices that involve multiple risky assets. \nThe analysis of portfolio choices will allow learners to characterize and determine investors’ optimal demand for risky assets, which will lay the foundation for the analysis of the Capital Asset Pricing Model, a milestone for asset pricing and financial economics. \nThe analysis of the CAPM will finally teach learners how to characterize equilibrium returns and asset prices in financial markets, also understanding the key forces that govern these key variables.",

It is specifically for folks who believe that writing poems just to express oneself is like using the Internet just for email. After all, poetry can change the way you and your readers think of the world and its inhabitants; it can break new ground for language; turn a blank sheet of paper into a teeming concert of voices and music.\n\nThough any of us may have the potential to make that happen, having an understanding of how several tools of poetic composition can be used (and audaciously “mis-used”) gives you more ways to try (and if we do this right, we might surprise ourselves most of all). \n\nWe'll cover key poetic terms and devices by studying poems by a handful of modern and contemporary poets and then get a chance to try our own hand at writing new poem drafts from a select number of prompts. Throughout the course you will have the opportunity to workshop your poem drafts and get feedback on your work, working towards a more polished poem.",

In today’s competitive business market, the key to success is wise data-driven decisions, made based on reliable information. As part of your work responsibilities, you would have discovered, synthesized, and analyzed information collected from various sources at some point in time. This is Business Analysis. It is the set of tasks, knowledge, and techniques required to identify business needs and determine solutions to enterprise business problems. Like we said earlier, a plethora of digital disruptions are taking place in every industry. We are witnessing the growth of a digital-ready culture with automation at its helm. Automation generates productivity boosts at the process, workflow, and workforce levels, thereby shaping organizational growth and longevity. With organizations moving towards automation, it’s of paramount importance for a Business Analyst to be skilled with the science of automation to facilitate communication and collaboration with relevant stakeholders. As a strong proponent of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), UiPath brings in the Automation Business Analyst role, who will be responsible for analyzing business requirements, identifying possible automatable processes as well as potential pitfalls, along with assessing the impact of automation implementation. Through this course, you will learn techniques for ensuring project success at every step-from understanding the enterprise problems or goals, to designing solutions, devising strategies, and thereby, driving change.  Along with the foundational business analysis skills, you will also learn how to incorporate business analysis deliverables and models into an RPA specific Process Definition Document (PDD), which is the representation of ‘as-is’ business processes that are chosen for automation. Throughout this course the terms ‘Robotic Process Automation’ (RPA) and ‘Automation’ have been used interchangeably. Aligned with IIBA's BABOK, this course will help you take the first step in your Business Analyst journey and will aid you with preparation for ECBA (Entry Certificate in Business Analysis).To complete this course, you will need IIBA’s BABOK Guide, which can be accessed at no additional cost.",

Your tax information is stored in the database used by the Internal Revenue Service. Your phone stores your contacts’   names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers in a database. If you shop online, you’re viewing photos, descriptions, and prices of products that are stored in a database. Database designers go to great lengths to design databases so that the data can be stored securely and in an organized format. It’s important to note that the main reason they go to all that work is so that we can get the data back out again when we need it! That’s called “data retrieval”. \n\nData is retrieved or read from a relational database by using a language called SQL to query (or question) the database. SQL is referred to as “the language of relational databases”. It can be used by itself or embedded in programs to retrieve data. Once the data is retrieved, it can be displayed on a web page or PC application, or even printed on paper. \n\nYou’ll be practicing writing SQL queries using SQLiteStudio. \n\nNext time you go online and look up the daily special at your favorite restaurant, you can think about the fact that it’s likely that an SQL query was used behind the scenes to fetch that data and pop it up on your screen. By the end of this course, you’ll even have a pretty good idea what the query might have looked like!\n\nNote: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

Current understandings of human history and social theory are based largely on Western experience or on non-Western experience seen through a Western lens. This course offers alternative perspectives derived from Chinese experience over the last three centuries. We present specific case studies of this new scholarship of discovery divided into two stand-alone parts, which means that students can take any part without prior or subsequent attendance of the other part.\n\nPart 1 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-china-history-part-1) focuses on comparative inequality and opportunity and addresses two related questions ‘Who rises to the top?’ and ‘Who gets what?’. \n\nPart 2 (this course) turns to an arguably even more important question ‘Who are we?’ as seen through the framework of comparative population behavior - mortality, marriage, and reproduction – and their interaction with economic conditions and human values. We do so because mortality and reproduction are fundamental and universal, because they differ historically just as radically between China and the West as patterns of inequality and opportunity, and because these differences demonstrate the mutability of human behavior and values.\n\nCourse Overview video: https://youtu.be/dzUPRyJ4ETk",

Este curso trata sobre cómo se decide qué problemas abordar y qué soluciones adoptar. Un proceso primordialmente político y social que suele escapar al análisis puramente racional.\n\nA lo largo del curso analizaremos por qué algunos problemas adquieren la categoría de problemas públicos mientras que otros no llegan a captar la atención, describiremos la pugna política que suele haber tras la descripción e interpretación de los problemas, identificaremos el complejo entramado de actores dispuestos a influir en la adopción de las políticas públicas, y cómo las discrepancias se suelen extender más allá de la toma de decisiones y hasta la aplicación práctica de la política pública. Trataremos también sobre las grandes dificultades que padecen gobiernos y actores sociales para llegar a saber si las políticas que se llevan a cabo son realmente útiles y cómo aprender a mejorar su rendimiento.\n\n Los objetivos de este curso son:\n1.\tMostrar a los alumnos un número de casos reales que ilustran la complejidad de los procesos de adopción de las políticas públicas, y cómo estos procesos pueden ser incoherentes con los modelos racionales de toma de decisiones.\n2.\tTransmitir a los alumnos los fundamentos e instrumental del análisis de políticas públicas para que puedan afrontar creativamente problemas del mundo real.\n3.\tContribuir a que los alumnos sean ciudadanos conocedores del funcionamiento de los sistemas democráticos.\n\n\nPor ello, el curso se dirige a todas las personas interesadas en los problemas colectivos, así como a aquellas que quieran convertirse en participantes influyentes en el proceso de formación de las políticas, ya sea como analistas, funcionarios públicos, trabajadores del tercer sector, o como ciudadanos comprometidos en causas políticas. También se dirige a estudiantes que se dispongan a iniciar estudios de grado o postgrado en administración pública, gestión pública o análisis de políticas públicas.",

This course goes beyond the hype of consumer IoT to emphasize broader application areas such as Advanced Manufacturing and Building Automation. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), is also known as Industry 4.0. Cisco’s CEO stated: “IoT overall is a $19 Trillion market. IIoT is a significant subset including digital oilfield, advanced manufacturing, power grid automation, and smart cities”. \n\nThis is part 1 of the specialization. The primary objective of this specialization is to closely examine emerging markets, technology trends, applications and skills required by engineering students, or working engineers, exploring career opportunities in the IIoT space. The structure of the course is intentionally wide and shallow: We will cover many topics, but will not go extremely deep into any one topic area, thereby providing a broad overview of the immense landscape of IIoT. There is one exception: We will study security in some depth as this is the most important topic for all \"Internet of Things\" product development. \n\nIn this course students will learn : \n  * What Industry 4.0 is and what factors have enabled the IIoT.\n  * Key skills to develop to be employed in the IIoT space.\n  * What platforms are, and also market information on Software and Services.\n  * What the top application areas are (examples include Manufacturing and Oil & Gas).\n  * What the top operating systems are that are used in IIoT deployments.\n  * About networking and wireless communication protocols used in IIoT deployments.\n  * About computer security; encryption techniques and secure methods for insuring data integrity and authentication.\n\nThis course can be taken for academic credit as part of CU Boulder’s Master of Science in Electrical Engineering (MS-EE) degree offered on the Coursera platform. The degree offers targeted courses, short 8-week sessions, and pay-as-you-go tuition. Admission is based on performance in three preliminary courses, not academic history.

        "description": "This course focuses on the recovery of the 3D structure of a scene from its 2D images. In particular, we are interested in the 3D reconstruction of a rigid scene from images taken by a stationary camera (same viewpoint). This problem is interesting as we want the multiple images of the scene to capture complementary information despite the fact that the scene is rigid and the camera is fixed. To this end, we explore several ways of capturing images where each image provides additional information about the scene.\n\nIn order to estimate scene properties (depth, surface orientation, material properties, etc.) we first define several important radiometric concepts, such as, light source intensity, surface illumination, surface brightness, image brightness and surface reflectance. Then, we tackle the challenging problem of shape from shading - recovering the shape of a surface from its shading in a single image. Next, we show that if multiple images of a scene of known reflectance are taken while changing the illumination direction, the surface normal at each scene point can be computed. This method, called photometric stereo, provides a dense surface normal map that can be integrated to obtain surface shape. \n\nNext, we discuss depth from defocus, which uses the limited depth of field of the camera to estimate scene structure. From a small number of images taken by changing the focus setting of the lens, a dense depth of the scene is recovered. Finally, we present a suite of techniques that use active illumination (the projection of light patterns onto the scene) to get precise 3D reconstructions of the scene. These active illumination methods are the workhorse of factory automation. They are used on manufacturing lines to assemble products and inspect their visual quality. They are also extensively used in other domains such as driverless cars, robotics, surveillance, medical imaging and special effects in movies.",

This course starts by asking “What is entrepreneurship?” to then begin applying commonly used business planning tools, such as design thinking and business model canvas. Design thinking is a methodology that encourages startups to focus on user-centric products and services. Topics like regulation, intellectual property, funding, and growth are covered as they relate to building startups.\n\nMany of the entrepreneurship opportunities and especially those in emerging markets arise out of necessity, driven to solve a real need or a social problem. Thus emerging markets are often seen as offering huge opportunities for disruptive innovation. Entrepreneurship has contributed to economic growth and has been able to respond to social problems, helping some communities prosper. With the rise of fintech, financial solutions using technologies such as the cloud, blockchain, and machine learning have bypassed or partnered with established financial institutions to serve new markets. \n\nWe invited some really interesting people in various stages of building their startups to explain their business development. We will be talking with Zlto (a digital currency), Yoco (mobile payments), Proof of Steak (alternative asset investment), and Kuba (a digital ‘middleman’ for small businesses) to name a few. \n\nAs we will learn, there is no such thing as being ‘ready’ or, choosing the ‘perfect time’ to become an entrepreneur. You are already one, so let’s take the next steps on your entrepreneurial journey by joining your peers around the world on this course. This course is for everyone anywhere, not only those inspired by fintech in emerging markets.",

Hemen her üniversite programında bir diferansiyel ve entegral hesap dersi var. Bu ders, çok önemli olmasına karşın, dünyada en az sevilen derslerden birisi de bu ders. Kimse dersin önemini inkâr etmiyor, ama ders hem öğrenci açısından hem de öğreticiler açısından sevimsiz bir deneyime dönüşüyor.\nBu dersin amacı: fonksiyonları tanıtmak. Niçin?\nMatematik bir dil. Sözel dillerde kelimeleri dilbilgisi kurallarıyla birleştirilerek gözlemleri ve düşünceleri oluşturuyoruz. Matematikte de benzer olarak, dilbilgisinin görevini birbiriyle çelişmeyen kabuller (aksiyomlar / postulatlar), kelimelerin görevini de işlemleri tanımlayan işaretler ve fonksiyonlar sağlıyor. Sözel dillerde en az binlerce kelime gerekirken, matematikte sadece onlarca “kelime” yani fonksiyon yeterli oluyor. Bu açıdan bakınca matematik sözel dillerden daha kolay olmalı...\nİşte bu nedenle, matematiğin kelimelerini, yani fonksiyonları tanımak çok önemli. Bu dersin amacı temel fonksiyonları tanıtmak. Bu fonksiyonları iyi bilmeyenler, matematik dilinde ilerlemekte, özel olarak da kalkülüste başarılı olamıyorlar.\n\nWhy this course: Precalculus?\nSingle variable functions are an introduction to calculus. Almost every university program has a course on differential and integral calculus. Although this course is very important, it is also one of the least popular courses in the world. No one denies the importance of the course, but it is not successful both for the students nor for the instructors. As a result, the lesson turns into an unpleasant experience for both the students and the instructors.\nThe aim of this course is to introduce functions. Why?\nMathematics is a language. In verbal languages, we combine words with grammatical rules to form observations and thoughts. In mathematics too, the task of grammar is to provide non-contradictory assumptions (axioms/postulates), and the task of words is provided by signs and functions that describe operations. While thousands of words are required in verbal languages, only dozens of \"words\" i. e. functions are sufficient in mathematics.

        "description": "Civil society organizations (CSOs) are key actors in development that have valuable contributions to make. They play a multitude of roles - including in relation to humanitarian assistance, service-delivery, research and policy development, and pursuing accountability from governments and other stakeholders – all of which can significantly contribute to the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). CSOs are expected to play a critical role in implementing the SDGs and in monitoring their progress. It is therefore urgent that CSOs meaningfully and effectively engage in development processes. But what is needed for CSOs to be able to do so? This Online Interactive Guidance offers some answers to that question. It takes participants through a history of the international commitments that call for this multi-stakeholder collaboration; what this means in practice for different development actors; and the benefits that can ensue through means of good practice examples from countries across the globe.\n\nLearning objectives\nFollowing the completion of the 5 modules of the Online Interactive Guidance, participants will be able to:\n•\tDescribe the rationale behind the need to engage civil society in development processes;\n•\tDefine the CSO enabling environment and CSO development effectiveness as key components to ensuring \n         effective engagement of CSOs in development;\n•\tRecall the international commitments on the CSO enabling environment and CSO development \n         effectiveness;\n•\tDistinguish the roles and responsibilities of different development actors in ensuring effective engagement \n        of CSOs in development;\n•\tIdentify practical ways in which governments, donors and civil society can engage to create a CSO enabling \n        environment and ensure CSO development effectiveness;\n•\tIdentify good practices for a CSO enabling environment and development effectiveness;\n•\tIndicate the benefits that can ensue from implementing good practices;\n•\tTranslate the international commitments and apply these to their own context.\n\nMethodology\nThis Online Interactive Guidance consists of five modules developed around the overall learning objectives. Each module starts with an animated video introducing the topic and is followed by good practice examples; insights from the field in the form of video interviews; in-depth readings; and an online activity. \n\nSet-up\nThe Online Guidance will lead participants through the modules that each play a part in creating an environment in which CSOs can meaningfully and effectively contribute to implementation and monitoring of international development processes. \n> Module 1 will examine the CSO-related commitments that the international community has subscribed to and will provide an introduction to the four ways in which these can be realized. \n> Module 2 will explore the means towards creating effective multi-stakeholder dialogue, which is key to creating a CSO enabling environment. \n> Module 3 will examine CSOs’ own responsibility in ensuring their effectiveness, accountability and transparency in their day-to-day operations.\n> Module 4 will delve into how providers of official development cooperation can effectively work with and for CSOs. \n> Module 5 is the concluding module and will examine how a country’s rules and regulations can determine an enabling environment for CSOs to operate in. \n\nCompletion\nParticipants who have completed the 5 modules can request a certificate extended by the Task Team on CSO Development Effectiveness & Enabling Environment.",

This included case-based learning, comprehensive factual knowledge, and consecutive quizzes, which help to better memorize the learned contents and later employ them in everyday situations in the field of trauma surgery.\n\nThe course participants are introduced to the multi-faceted field of the treatment of trauma patients. Different trauma mechanism and their sequelae are elucidated, as well as the respective gold standard of medical treatment of these injuries by means of modern trauma surgery. All episodes – of which each one is dedicated to a distinct pathology – follow the same approach:\n•\tIntroduction and/or repetition of the anatomic principles\n•\tPrelude of the topic by means of a film\n•\tClassification of the treated wound, e.g. according to AO\n•\tSummary of relevant and current therapeutic options\n•\tEach episode is interspersed with short quizzes to immediately recapitulate the learned contents and which will help solving the exam quizzes\nThe course was compiled by an interdisciplinary team of internationally renowned experts from the special field of orthopedic surgery from Germany. Depending on the respective consultant’s specialization, suitable case scenarios from our clinic are presented.\n\nDieser Kurs ist auch in deutscher Sprache verfügbar.

        "description": "Littéralement « amour de l’humanité », la philanthropie désigne aujourd’hui l'ensemble des dons librement consentis par des acteurs privés en faveur de l'intérêt général. Dans les médias, la philanthropie est incarnée aujourd’hui par les milliardaires américains Bill Gates et Warren Buffet qui ont donné une grande part de leur fortune à une fondation en faveur de la santé et de l’éducation. Mais cette vision est partielle : la philanthropie est très active dans la plupart des régions du monde, pas seulement aux Etats-Unis, et ce ne sont pas seulement les très riches qui donnent, puisque de nombreux particuliers et entreprises s’impliquent. \n\nEn ce début de XXIe siècle marqué par les crises économiques et politiques, la philanthropie joue un rôle croissant pour répondre aux grands défis de notre temps. Alternative au modèle marchand et à la redistribution publique via l’impôt, le don privé est activement recherché pour financer la lutte contre la pauvreté, l’éducation, la recherche médicale ou la culture… Partout dans le monde, les fondations se multiplient, les dons se développent et influencent la vie de très nombreuses personnes. Les besoins sont immenses et la concurrence pour trouver des fonds n’a jamais été aussi vive. \n\nMalgré son importance, la philanthropie reste mal connue notamment en France et en Europe. Plusieurs questions clés restent en suspens : De quoi parle-t-on exactement ? Qu’est-ce qui motive les philanthropes et favorise leur action ? Quelles sont les différentes façons d’agir en philanthropie ? Quel est son impact et comment l’évaluer? L’objectif de ce MOOC est de répondre à ces quatre grandes questions, en mobilisant les dernières avancées en matière de recherche et le point de vue d’experts reconnus dans leur domaine. \n\nQue vous soyez simplement curieux de découvrir le sujet, déjà donateur ou engagé dans une démarche philanthropique, ou un professionnel qui accompagne ou sollicite des philanthropes, ce MOOC est fait pour vous ! Chaque semaine, vous progresserez grâce à des vidéos alliant théorie et pratique, des lectures pour aller plus loin, des quiz pour renforcer vos acquis et des forums où vous pourrez échanger entre participants et avec l’équipe pédagogique. A l’issue de ce MOOC, vous aurez toutes les clés en main pour comprendre et agir en faveur d’un monde meilleur !\n\nCe MOOC est réalisé par la chaire Philanthropie de l’ESSEC, en collaboration avec la Fondation de France. \n\nLa chaire Philanthropie de l’ESSEC bénéficie du soutien de la Fondation de France, de la Fondation Daniel & Nina Carasso, des Fondations Edmond de Rothschild, de la Fondation Bettencourt Schueller et de la Fondation Caritas France.",

Personal life is enriched when these same skills are applied to problems in everyday life involving judgment and choice. This course presents basic concepts from statistics, probability, scientific methodology, cognitive psychology and cost-benefit theory and shows how they can be applied to everything from picking one product over another to critiquing media accounts of scientific research. Concepts are defined briefly and breezily and then applied to many examples drawn from business, the media and everyday life.\n\nWhat kinds of things will you learn? Why it’s usually a mistake to interview people for a job. Why it’s highly unlikely that, if your first meal in a new restaurant is excellent, you will find the next meal to be as good. Why economists regularly walk out of movies and leave restaurant food uneaten. Why getting your picture on the cover of Sports Illustrated usually means your next season is going to be a disappointment. Why you might not have a disease even though you’ve tested positive for it. Why you’re never going to know how coffee affects you unless you conduct an experiment in which you flip a coin to determine whether you will have coffee on a given day. Why it might be a mistake to use an office in a building you own as opposed to having your office in someone else’s building. Why you should never keep a stock that’s going down in hopes that it will go back up and prevent you from losing any of your initial investment.

        "description": "Do you dream of being a CMIO or a Senior Director of Clinical Informatics? If you are aiming to rise up in the ranks in your health system or looking to pivot your career in the direction of big data and health IT, this course is made for you. You'll hear from experts at Johns Hopkins about their experiences harnessing the power of big data in healthcare, improving EHR adoption, and separating out the hope vs hype when it comes to digital medicine. \n\nWhether you're a nurse, pharmacist, physician, other allied health professional or come from a non-clinical background--you know that Health Informatics skills are in demand. This newly launched 5-course specialization by JohnsHopkins faculty members provides a solid foundation for anyone wanting to become a leader in  one of the hottest fields in healthcare. \n\nAs health informaticians, we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state (as-is), the future state (to-be) and any unintended consequences that can result from our interventions. Prior to introducing large scale change, we need to assess whether a healthcare organization is truly ready for change. This involves taking into account an organization's current culture and values. Successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations. Proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use. \n\nBy the end of this course, students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics, and the reasons for each. Students will be armed with tools to help optimize their chances for successfully leading change in their respective organizations. ",

Hasta el momento, el desarrollo económico ha estado basado en un crecimiento continuo basado en el uso de recursos naturales sin tener en cuenta las consecuencias derivadas de su uso ineficientes, y los impactos ambientales que generan en el medio ambiente.\nFrente a esta situación, desde hace unos años se ha intensificado el debate sobre cómo debería ser la economía para permitir un desarrollo más sustentable. Uno de los conceptos que ha ganado fuerza es el de la Economía Circular, que sirviéndose de la investigación desarrollada desde finales de 1970’s se inspira para plantear productos, y sistemas industriales y urbanos más respetuosos con el medio ambiente. La economía circular, pues, no es un concepto del todo nuevo. Representa una nueva forma de entender y analizar sistemas actuales, y de promover sistemas y productos más respetuosos con el medio ambiente.\nEn este curso aprenderás lo fundamentos de la economía circular, las cifras actuales que demuestran la necesidad de avanzar hacia sistemas y productos circulares, y sobre todo las herramientas básicas para poder analizar los sistemas socioeconómicos actuales.\nLa estructura del curso contempla 5 sesiones, cada uno requiere una dedicación de unas 4 horas de estudio y práctica. La primera sesión explica las distintas escuelas de pensamiento que han servido para desarrollar el concepto de la Economía Circular. Durant la segunda sesión, os mostraré cuales son los compromisos políticos y los planes de acción en EC en Europa que se están implementando para mejorar ambientalmente la economía actual. Las tres sesiones siguientes describen los fundamentos básicos para analizar un sistema y producto desde un punto de vista físico. Después de hacer una introducción sobre los principios de termodinámica, y de conservación de la materia, aprenderás como se usan para el análisis de sistemas. También hablaremos sobre el ecodiseño o diseño para el medio ambiente, y finalmente de cómo algunas de estas herramientas se aplican conjuntamente.\nEl curso está orientado a profesionales en medio ambiente y gestión de empresas, también universitarios de pregrado y estudiantes de posgrado y tecnólogos.",

You will decompose your project into the main elements, then further decompose those into even smaller, more manageable pieces of work.  As we decompose our project into smaller elements, we will be using decomposition rules such as the 100%, and the mutually exclusive elements rules. You will continue decomposition until you get elements that can be estimated properly and that you can delegate to a person or a team.  You will also create a WBS dictionary, explaining the elements in your WBS.  We will do all of this in Google Sheet, but the same concepts can be used with any tool, i.e. Excel SP, WBS creation tools, etc.\n\nNote: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region.

Through this course, I hope that you will come to appreciate that war is both a natural expression of common human emotions and interactions and a constitutive part of how we cohere as groups. That is, war is paradoxically an expression of our basest animal nature and the exemplar of our most vaunted and valued civilized virtues. You will learn some basic military history and sociology in this course as a lens for the more important purpose of seeing the broader social themes and issues related to war. I want you to both learn about war, but more importantly, use it as way of understanding your everyday social world. So, for example, the discussion of war and gender will serve to start you thinking about how expectations of masculinity are created and our discussion of nationalism will make clear how easy “us-them” dichotomies can be established and (ab)used. I will suggest some readings for you to complement the class and assign some activities through which you will be able to apply the theoretical insights from the course to your observations of everyday life. At the end of the course, you will start to see war everywhere and come to appreciate how much it defines our life.\n\nAll the features of this course are available for free.

This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Coordination Research and Innovation Action under Grant Agreement No. 826497.\n\nThe course \"Cybersecurity in Healthcare\" has been developed to raise awareness and understanding the role of cybersecurity in healthcare (e.g., hospitals, care centres, clinics, other medical or social care institutions and service organisations) and the challenges that surround it. In this course, we will cover both theoretical and practical aspects of cybersecurity. We look at both social aspects as technical aspects that come into play. Furthermore, we offer helpful resources that cover different aspects of cybersecurity. Even if you are not active in the healthcare domain, you will find helpful tips and insights to deal with cybersecurity challenges within any other organisation or in personal contexts as well.\n\nThis course begins by introducing the opportunities and challenges that digitalisation of healthcare services has created. It explains how the rise of technologies and proliferation of (medical) data has become an attractive target to cybercriminals, which is essential in understanding  why  adequate cybersecurity measures are critical within the healthcare environment. In later modules, course contents cover the threats, both inside and outside of healthcare organisations like e.g. social engineering and hacking. Module 4 on Cyber Hygiene describes how to improve cybersecurity within healthcare organisations in practical ways.  Module 5 looks deeper into how organisational culture affects cybersecurity, the cybersecurity culture, focusing on the interaction between human behaviour and technology and how organisational factors can boost or diminish the level and attention to cybersecurity in healthcare.\n\nDo you work for a hospital, clinic, medical practice, care centre, care provider, social care organisation, or nursing home? Do you want to improve your personal or your organisation’s cybersecurity (cyber security, IT security, information security, network security, computer security, awareness)? Then please visit https://www.securehospitals.eu to gain access to a range of resources.

The course provides hands-on experience with building detailed financial statements like the Profit & Loss statement, Cash Flow Waterfall, and Balance Sheet. Throughout, you'll develop a comprehensive understanding of how to construct models that are both dynamic and adaptable to real-world projects.\n\nFinally, you will wrap up by calculating return metrics like the Internal Rate of Return (IRR), which is crucial for assessing project viability. By the end of the course, you’ll be fully equipped to handle every stage of a project’s financial modeling lifecycle, from initial assumptions to detailed cash flow forecasts and financial statement analysis.\n\nThis course is designed for finance professionals, analysts, and anyone looking to specialize in project finance. A basic understanding of Excel is recommended, though no prior finance experience is necessary. Those with an interest in infrastructure, energy, and large-scale project financing will benefit from the practical skills covered.",

Asimismo, serás consiente de cómo en el proceso, el fracaso y la resiliencia te ayudarán a avanzar en tus restos de liderazgo. Al finalizar este curso estarás en capacidad de:\n\n1.\tUtilizar herramientas de diagnóstico y acción para avanzar en un proyecto de liderazgo propio.\n2.\tPracticar y profundizar el uso de narrativas y otras herramientas de comunicación (con uno mismo y con otros) para fortalecer el ejercicio personal de liderazgo.\n3.\tDesarrollar resiliencia, una habilidad que permite perseverar en proyectos de liderazgo.\n\nEl Programa especializado en “Liderazgo Efectivo para el Siglo XXI”, es el primer programa especializado en línea, abierto y masivo que se produce desde el Centro de Liderazgo Público (CLP) de la Escuela de Gobierno Alberto Lleras Camargo de la Universidad de los Andes, Colombia. El CLP tiene como misión crear conocimiento y capacidad de liderazgo para ayudar a que progresemos en los temas complejos que más nos importan en el mundo actual. \n\nEl programa fue diseñado por Maite Careaga Tagüeña, PhD y Héctor Fabio Hernández, MPP, con el apoyo de Saluma Castillo y el equipo Conecta-TE de la Universidad de los Andes, Colombia, y está inspirado en los cursos y talleres  de liderazgo que Maite lleva 15 años diseñando y facilitando  (los primeros los diseñó junto con Felipe Bozzo y Sebastián Quirmbach en Leaderbuilding) y en las lecciones aprendidas  al investigar cómo diseñar y evaluar estrategias pedagógicas para enseñar habilidades personales y sociales para el liderazgo.\n\nEste curso ha sido diseñado como el cuarto y último del programa especializado (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/liderazgo), el cual te permitirá adueñarte de una metodología de intervención, que llamamos espiral de liderazgo consciente, y desarrollar y aplicar una caja de herramientas para movilizar personas (a sí mismo y a otros) a trabajar en solucionar los desafíos complejos que las afectan e importan. Los otros tres cursos del programa son: \"Estilos de Liderazgo: opciones para avanzar en desafíos complejos\", \"Autoliderazgo y Gestión de Emociones para Avanzar en Desafíos Complejos\" y \"Comunicación, Experimentación y Aprendizaje en Liderazgo\". Puedes tomar todos los cursos por separado o sólo uno de ellos, sin embargo te recomendamos que te inscribas y participes en los cuatro, ojalá en el orden que te proponemos.",

Then we will learn to create an active/passive set up using Failover Routing Policy where you can have a primary website and a secondary Disaster Recovery site.. \n\nWe will then look at Geolocation Routing Policy which will send your traffic to various servers based on the Geographic location of your users which can for example allow for custom sites based on user location. Finally, we will see Multi-Value Answer Policy which lets you configure Route53 to return multiple values along with health checks.\n\nNote: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We’re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.",

Learners investigate how such an economy cannot sustain itself and the need for a rapid transition to something different. We define sustainability, the meaning of sustainable development, and the United Nations' Sustainability Goals. \n \nRecognizing that change is imperative, we begin looking at energy, and more specifically, power generation as this is widely understood as the leading cause of climate change today. We show why this is the case and explore pathways to reduce carbon emissions, such as through the transition from coal and natural gas to renewables such as wind and solar. The concept of the carbon footprint and how it is determined is introduced. Learners have the opportunity to calculate their own personal carbon footprint under a variety of power source options (coal, natural gas, or renewable), and discover what would happen to their personal carbon footprint if they moved toward renewable energies.",

I'm excited to have you in the class and look forward to your contributions to the other learners in our community.\n\nThis free course will provide the knowledge and  the tools needed to understand what cities do, why they matter, the forces shaping the greatest wave of urbanization in history, and how to pick the right place for you. The course will also help you develop critical thinking skills. We'll accomplish this by providing evidence of the importance of cities, and why and how they matter to you. Then we’ll ask you to apply what you’ve learned in an exercise which will help you assess your own community and find your best place.\n\n This course is accessible and open to anyone who is interested in learning more about cities and the ways they affect our lives. It is organized around five key modules: (1) Why Cities Matter,  (2) A World of Cities,  (3) The Creative City, (4) The Divided City and the New Urban Crisis, and (5) How to Find the Best Place for You.\n\n After completing the course, you will be able to:\n\n\n(1) Identify why cities are the drivers of economic prosperity;\n(2) Explain the drivers and implications of fast-growing urbanization worldwide;\n(3) Outline the key characteristics of a creative and innovative city;\n(4) Describe the social divides and challenges facing cities and the solutions cities are using to address them; and\n(5) Recognize the trade-offs of staying in your current city versus moving, and identify the best place for you and your family to live.\n\nOf course the world has changed a great deal since I developed this course. The Global COVID-19 Pandemic is affecting cities, businesses and people around the world. It is something I have been writing about and working with mayors, city managers, economic developers, urban leaders and communities across the globe. I have put together a new module on Cities and the Coronavirus to help you better understand the ways in which the Covid-19 crisis is impacting cities and how you can best understand  and deal with that.\n\nI’d like to wish each and every one of you good luck as you get started on this journey.

D’Aristote à Kant, de Bentham à Derrida, à travers un voyage philosophique passionnant nous entrerons dans le vif du débat éthique contemporain.\n\nNotre monde toujours plus complexe semble nous échapper. Réchauffement climatique, questions de début et de fin de vie, évolution vertigineuse des bio-technologies, inégale distribution des richesses, pressions migratoires accentuées… La tentation est grande d’une vie morale repliée sur elle-même à partir d’une éthique minimale : « fais ce que tu veux, du moment que tu ne mets pas en péril la liberté des autres ». Nous proposons de prendre le contre-pied : défendre l’idée d’une éthique qui nous plonge dans notre réalité sociale et politique, parmi nos semblables et avec eux. Et pour cela nous reposons la question de ce qui est juste, de ce qui est bien. Sans repartir de rien, sans tout réinventer.\nC’est pourquoi nous présentons un cours qui permet de se familiariser avec les plus importantes perspectives éthiques traversant le monde contemporain : l’éthique des vertus (ou perfectionnisme) ; l’éthique du devoir (ou déontologisme) ; l’éthique utilitariste (ou conséquentialisme) ; l’éthique de l’amour (ou éthique du don). Ainsi chacun pourra mettre de l’ordre dans ses idées, repérer les différentes manières de s’orienter dans la vie morale, comprendre les différences d’appréciation face aux diverses situations qui interpellent et sollicitent.\n\nQuels que soient votre champ de savoir académique, votre engagement professionnel ou vos choix personnels, il s’agit de proposer des clés d’analyse dont vous disposerez. Pour cela, nous alternerons tout au long de ce cours les présentations des grands courants, sous leur forme ancienne puis contemporaine, et des questions plus transversales ou des cas concrets. Avec un seul but : clarifier les idées pour mieux comprendre le réel et mieux orienter l’action.\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nAbout this course:\n\nThis course presents the main schools of thought that frame today’s ethical reflection and affect everyone in their personal, social and civic life. From Aristotle to Kant, from Bentham to Derrida, we will take you to the heart of contemporary ethical debates through a fascinating philosophical journey. Our increasingly complex world seems to elude our grasp. Global warming, beginning and end-of-life issues, the dizzying evolution of bio-technologies, the unequal distribution of wealth, heightened migratory pressures ... In response, we are tempted to make the moral life a self-legislating and isolated affair: \"do what you want, as long as you do not put at risk the freedom of others\". We propose to go against this trend and to defend the idea of ​​an ethics that immerses us in our social and political reality, in and amongst our peers. We thus reformulate the question of what is right and what is good. This is not to say we are starting from scratch and reinventing the wheel. Rather, we will offer a course that allows you to encounter the most important ethical perspectives of our contemporary world: virtue ethics (or perfectionism); ethics of duty (or deontology); utilitarianism (or consequentialism); ethics of love (or ethics of the gift). Everyone will thus have a chance to evaluate his or her ideas, to identify different approaches to the moral life, and to understand a range of perspectives on different situations that face us in our lives. Whatever your field of academic knowledge, your professional commitments or personal choices, this course presents key concepts for further analysis. Therefore, we will alternate discussions of the founding schools of ethical thought, in their ancient and contemporary formulations, with cross-disciplinary issues and applied case studies. The goal throughout is to clarify ideas in order to better understand reality and orient human action.\n\n- - - - - - - - -- - - -- - - - - - - -- - - - - - -- \n善、正义、功用：哲学伦理学导论\n \n本课程旨在向大家介绍伦理学的主要流派，这些流派对如今的伦理思考意义非凡，并且涉及到每个人的个人生活、社会生活和公民生活。\n从亚里士多德到康德，从边沁到德里达，通过引人入胜的哲学之旅，我们将进入当代伦理学辩论的核心问题。",

This course, from the Corrosion@Manchester team in collaboration with AkzoNobel, will teach you why metals corrode, what the environmental consequences are, how much corrosion costs and how corrosion can be controlled. It is designed for students, householders, teachers, professionals and anyone in-between.\n \nThe aim of the course is to introduce the complex world of corrosion and corrosion control. While a full appreciation of corrosion science involves elements of materials science, electrochemistry and physics while corrosion engineering requires a practical knowledge of corrosion failures and engineering design this course does not need an extensive background knowledge. The course mirrors elements of the Corrosion Control Engineering teaching programme at The University of Manchester for final-year undergraduates and masters-level postgraduates and is used as a supplementary learning resource by our students.",

As an IT support specialist, you’ll be asked to troubleshoot issues with a wide variety of tools. You'll see a scenario with a medical device installation where issues related to IP addresses, networking, and MAC addresses come up.  \n\nWhen there are disruptions in technology, you’ll need to use training, tip sheets, and problem-solving skills to determine how best to handle the situation. Supporting a high reliability organization means being familiar with the existing processes and protocols for handling calls, creating tickets, escalating issues, and resolving matters. We’ll introduce you to the concept of self-service tickets and the guidance given to hospital staff on how to submit a ticket. You’ll learn about the different priority levels for tickets as well as the tiers of IT support. When a call comes in, there are some important resources you’ll need to access in order to troubleshoot the problem. These can range from standard question templates to tip sheets to complex matrices and knowledge base articles (KBAs). Having these tools in your arsenal is essential as a Health IT support specialist. We‘ll also cover the JIRA process, the need for excellent documentation, and ways in which requests for change are communicated.",

Just 30 years after his death, an algorithm for encryption of secret messages was developed using achievements of number theory. It was called RSA after the names of its authors, and its implementation is probably the most frequently used computer program in the world nowadays. Without it, nobody would be able to make secure payments over the internet, or even log in securely to e-mail and other personal services. In this course we will start with the basics of the number theory and get to cryptographic protocols based on it. By the end, you will be able to apply the basics of the number theory to encrypt and decrypt messages, and to break the code if one applies RSA carelessly. You will even pass a cryptographic quest!\n\nAs prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), basic programming in python (functions, loops, recursion), common sense and curiosity. Our intended audience are all people that work or plan to work in IT, starting from motivated high school students.",

        "description": "Join our new short course and learn from Jerry Liu, co-founder and CEO at LlamaIndex to start using agentic RAG, a framework designed to build research agents skilled in tool use, reasoning, and decision-making with your data.\n\nIn this course:\n\n1. Build the simplest form of agentic RAG – a router. Given a query, the router will pick one of two query engines, Q&A or summarization, to execute a query over a single document.\n\n2. Add tool calling to your router agent where you will use an LLM to not only pick a function to execute but also infer an argument to pass to the function.\n\n3. Build a research assistant agent. Instead of tool calling in a single-shot setting, an agent is able to reason over tools in multiple steps. \n\n4. Build a multi-document agent where you will learn how to extend the research agent to handle multiple documents.\n\nUnlike the standard RAG pipeline—suitable for simple queries across a few documents—this intelligent approach adapts based on initial findings to enhance further data retrieval. You’ll learn to develop an autonomous research agent, enhancing your ability to engage with and analyze your data comprehensively.\n\nYou’ll practice building agents capable of intelligently navigating, summarizing, and comparing information across multiple research papers from arXiv. Additionally, you’ll learn how to debug these agents, ensuring you can guide their actions effectively. \n\nExplore one of the most rapidly advancing applications of agentic AI!",

We will explore changes in the family and the resulting debates about how to best support families and child development.  We’ll appraise family leave and child care programs for their role in supporting paid work and in strengthening child development, as well as income support efforts including the child tax credit and proposals for a family allowance.  \n\n-The second module begins with a description of child poverty—both the forces leading to it, and its effects.  This module also describes public support programs and critiques the debates surrounding them.\n\n-The third module focuses on persons living with disabilities, evaluating the  landmark Americans with Disabilities Act.   We will also critique the processes of establishing a disability social insurance program and the public aid programs that make people with disabilities eligible for income support and health support.  \n\n-The final module begins with a report on the aging of the U.S. population.  Building on this, we’ll examine social insurance programs and public aid programs for seniors for their longterm viability, and assess the various reforms that have been proposed to stabilize these programs. \n \nThe course is part of a sequence in social policy that has an HONORS TRACK.

        "description": "In the dynamic field of HVAC technology, strategies like Demand Control Ventilation (DCV) are revolutionizing indoor air quality and energy efficiency. DCV dynamically adjusts ventilation rates based on real-time occupancy and air quality indicators, optimizing conditions for occupants while minimizing energy consumption. Adherence to codes and standards, notably ASHRAE Standard 62.1, ensures the safety and efficiency of DCV systems.\n\nA key focus of DCV is monitoring and controlling carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, a crucial indicator of indoor air quality. Elevated CO2 levels prompt real-time adjustments in ventilation rates, preventing the accumulation of pollutants and promoting a constant supply of fresh air. This adaptive approach aligns with principles promoting occupant health and well-being.\n\nDesigning ventilation rates within DCV involves considering factors such as occupancy, space size, and specific application requirements. Strategies like damper control and precise positioning efficiently meet ventilation demands. DCV's versatility extends to both Constant Air Volume (CAV) and Variable Air Volume (VAV) systems.\n\nIn Constant Air Volume (CAV) systems, DCV optimizes airflow by modulating it based on real-time occupancy and air quality data. This ensures ventilation precisely tailored to the immediate needs of the space, balancing energy efficiency and air quality maintenance. In Variable Air Volume (VAV) systems, DCV adjusts the air supply to match demand, optimizing energy conservation without compromising air quality. An example illustrates the seamless integration of DCV within a VAV system, showcasing practical impact.\n\nCO2 sensors, including advanced types like nondispersive infrared (NDIR) sensors, play a pivotal role in DCV systems. Proper sensor placement ensures accurate readings, enhancing overall effectiveness by providing precise data on indoor air quality.\n\nShifting to the broader context of HVAC, understanding fans, their history, and diverse applications is essential. Fans, integral to industrial processes and electronics cooling, have evolved with various types, including centrifugal and axial fans. Appreciating fan terminologies like pressure, flow rate, speed, and efficiency becomes vital.\n\nCentrifugal fans excel in scenarios requiring directed and pressurized airflow, while axial fans are ideal for linear airflow applications. Grasping fan terminologies is crucial for optimizing performance. The affinity laws and fan control strategies govern efficiency, providing insights into operational optimization. Fan performance curves visually depict relationships between airflow, pressure, and power consumption, aiding in selecting and optimizing fan systems.\n\nExpanding the horizon, Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) systems mark a milestone in HVAC technology. Evolving from traditional systems, VRF systems offer a dynamic and energy-efficient approach. Continuous advancements introduce features like individual zone control, energy efficiency, and adaptability to variable loads.\n\nThe escalating demand for energy-efficient HVAC solutions underscores the need for VRF systems. Their capacity for simultaneous heating and cooling, coupled with precise temperature control, makes them preferred in various applications. Designing VRF systems involves meticulous consideration of factors like building size, occupancy, and specific requirements for each zone. The connectivity or combination ratio, indicating the number of indoor units connected to a single outdoor unit, significantly influences system efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, from Demand Control Ventilation to advanced fan systems and Variable Refrigerant Flow, these strategies form a comprehensive picture of HVAC technology. Rooted in energy efficiency and sustainability, they play a pivotal role in shaping the future of indoor environmental control, catering to occupant comfort, operational efficiency, and environmental responsibility.\n\n\nTarget Learners:\n1.\tKnowledge of Thermodynamics & Heat Transfer \n2.\tUndergraduate students of Mechanical who are in either Vth, VIth, VIIth or VIIIth semester\n3.\tGraduate students of Mechanical\n4.\tWorking professionals with B.Tech./B.E., in Mechanical \n5.\tDiploma students of  Mechanical",

If you have, you’ll look at your process differently, taking control of aspects of the process you may have not noticed.\n\nThe course will start by examining the tools available to you, all revolving around the essential concept of prosody. You’ll learn to use your tools to enhance your message—to work compositionally at the same time you’re developing your ideas.\n\nYou’ll be working both lyrically and musically, though musically it’s not necessary that you either read music or play an instrument. If you play, great, and you’ll be encouraged to play and record your musical responses to the assignments. If you don’t play, the course offers you a number of musical loops to work with. All you’ll have to do is sing your melodies over the loops.\n\nAssignments will ask you to post something for peer review—sometimes lyric lines or sections, sometimes melodies, sometimes both. None of it has to be polished. The course is about writing, not performing.\n\nMost important, you’ll have a lot of fun.",

The introduction of Smart urban technologies into legacy infrastructures has resulted in numerous challenges and opportunities for contemporary cities and will continue to do so. This course will help you to understand how to make the best of these smart technologies in your cities’ legacy infrastructures.  \nOver the past few years, advances in the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have significantly challenged the traditionally stable land scape of urban infrastructure service provision. This has resulted in increasing interest from both technology vendors and public authorities in the transition of cities towards so-called “Smart Cities”. Although such “Smart technologies” can provide immense opportunities for citizens and service providers alike, the ICTs often act as disruptive innovators of urban infrastructure service provision.\nIn this MOOC, you will gain a thorough understanding of the challenges and opportunities associated with the Smart urban infrastructures, namely Smart urban transportation and Smart urban energy systems. Over the journey of this 5-week online course you will learn about the most important principles for the management of Smart urban infrastructures as well as the applications of these principles in the transportation and energy sectors. \nThis course does not have any prerequisites. However, to take the most away from of this MOOC, we strongly encourage you to enroll in our other MOOC on the Management of Urban Infrastructures, which has been widely praised by learners. \nThrough this course, you will:\n- Gain a deep understanding of the nature of disruptive innovations (smart technologies) in urban infrastructure systems;\n- Learn about state-of-the-art strategies for effectively managing the transition from legacy infrastructures to smart urban systems;\n- Study the management of the transition phase from legacy infrastructure systems to smart cities by supporting innovations while avoiding early lock-in; and\n- Understand potential applications of the materials learned in this course within the context of the management of smart urban transportation systems as well as smart urban energy systems.",

Because we’re usually in a rush, we don’t have the luxury of finding out all the information that we would like to. But no matter the situation, our understanding of the human story will determine a great deal about our communication.\n\nResearch shows that when we hear a story, our brain begins to sync with the storyteller. We quickly make connections drawn from our own lives and can fill in other aspects in a story like meaning, emotion, narrative trajectory and so on.\n\nAs the listener, it’s relatively easy to hear a story and imagine, empathize and even come up with possible solutions to alleviate pain. But not so easy when you are the provider—and part of the story itself. Why is that? Why can we do it from a distance, but it’s so difficult to see when we are one of the people in the story? This course discusses these questions.\n\nJoin palliative care physician Dr. Kathryn Winters, along with the Sanford Institute’s Center for Compassionate Communication at UC San Diego Health, for this fascinating, personal and instructive lesson on how to better understand the stories involved in clinical care—both provider and patient.",

This is a straightforward opportunity to put into practice all the knowledge you have acquired, and to confirm that the negotiation process is dynamic and can always be improved.\n\nThe course integrates the most recent advances in the development of negotiation skills, based on modern life complexities, in a simple and direct way.\n\nWe start out with the structure of effective communication in a negotiation, with the intention of identifying our opportunity areas, and improving them through active learning mechanisms.\n\nAnd what can we say about the role emotions play in a negotiation process? It is necessary to acknowledge , manage, and take advantage of them by using emotional intelligence mechanisms.\n\nNegotiation, by definition, implies the relationship between two or more parties who eventually express opposing interests and demand skills for problem-solving. In this course you will learn to identify and manage its irreversible consequences in advance.",

        "description": "Learn how debt and equity can be used to finance infrastructure investments and how investors approach infrastructure investments! \n\nAccording to the OECD, the global infrastructure investment requirement by 2030 for transport, electricity generation, transmission & distribution, and water & telecommunications totals to 71 trillion dollars. This figure represents about 3.5% of the annual World GDP from 2007 to 2030.\n\nThe European Commission estimated, that by 2020, Europe will need between 1.5 - 2 trillion Euros in infrastructure investments. Between 2011 and 2020, about 500 billion Euros will be required for the implementation of the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) program, 400 billion Euros for Energy distribution networks and smart grids, 200 billion Euros on Energy transmission networks and storage, and 500 billion Euros for the upgrade and construction of new power plants. An additional 38 - 58 billion Euros and 181 - 268 billion Euros in capital investment will be needed to achieve the targets set by the European Commission for broadband diffusion.\n\nTraditionally investments in infrastructure were financed using public sources. However, severe budget constraints and inefficient management of infrastructure by public entities have led to an increased involvement of private investors in the business. \n\nThe course focuses on how private investors approach infrastructure projects from the standpoint of equity, debt, and hybrid instruments. \n\nThe course concentrates on the practical aspects of project finance: the most frequently used financial techniques for infrastructure investments. The repeated use of real life examples and case studies will allow students to link the theoretical background to actual business practices.\n\nIn the end of the course, students will be capable of analyzing a complex transaction, identifying the key elements of a deal, and suggesting proper solutions for deal structuring from a financial advisor's perspective.\n\nCourse Format\nThe course will consist of lecture videos, readings, and talks given by guest speakers. Although we do hope you will attend the entire course, it is possible to just focus on single topics.\n\nSuggested Readings\nThe course is designed to be self-contained, there are no obligatory readings that must be acquired outside of the course. \nFor students interested in additional study material, you may refer to:\n•\tGatti Stefano, \"Project Finance in theory and practice\", Academic Press, 2nd edition, 2012.",

Led by expert educators, including Whitney Soule, Dean of Admissions at the University of Pennsylvania, and Dr. Sean Vereen and Sara Woods, Co-presidents of Heights Philadelphia, this free course will help students, family members, college counselors, and any curious learner to navigate each stage from the start of the college search process through preparing your applications to colleges.  \n\nThis course includes a variety of videos, readings, and activities—all designed to encourage self-reflection, information sharing, and moments of connection.  \n\nIn this course, you’ll learn about:  \n\n1. The organizational skills you’ll need to be successful in this process  \n\n2. Important financial aid resources and how to make college affordable   \n\n3. How to better understand your story and how it connects to what interests you and what colleges look for  \n\n4. How to find your right college fit \n\n5. The steps and materials needed to complete your college application \n\nThis course is designed for students who are planning to apply to college soon (11th graders and 12th graders), but the activities and videos can still be useful for students who are earlier in their college search journey as they plan for the future. Regardless of where you are in your understanding of the college search process—from those who are the first in their family to pursue a bachelor’s degree and who may be trying to figure out where to even begin—to those who are well on their way to preparing an application—this course provides a road map to helping you move through this journey in your own way and on your own time.    \n\nThis course is open to the public, asynchronous, and self-directed without a facilitator. Please note although this course is designed by the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), this is not a course about applying to Penn.  \n\nThe course is also intended for students who may not have access to college counseling – if you attend a school that offers college counseling, your counselor is the best source of information on applying to college.  \n\nThis course is for students who are applying to college for the first time, intending to pursue undergraduate degrees at a four-year institution in the U.S. \n\nIf you are an international student attending a school outside the U.S. interested in learning more about navigating the U.S. university system and application process, we recommend enrolling in this course: Applying to US Universities.",

Today, in general, most people are dazzled by the technical possibilities offered by forensic science. They somewhat live in the illusion that forensic evidence is fool proof and brings factual findings with 100% certainty. This course – given by specialists in the field – goes beyond the conventional image that is promoted through TV series such as CSI. It alerts (without alarming) the public on the limits of the techniques in order to promote a sound administration of forensic science in the criminal justice system.  It allows participants to understand the importance of probabilistic reasoning in forensic science, because uncertainty is a constitutive part of forensic science. The course is constructed as a series of causes célèbres that could or have led to miscarriages of justice. Some of these cases have been part of case reviews carried out at the School of Criminal Justice of the University of Lausanne.\n******************\nSpecial thanks to our translators, in particular the University of Lausanne and the School of Criminal Justice sincerely thank Massimiliano Stabile (forensic biologist), Francesco Zampa (forensic chemist) and Giampietro Lago (forensic biologist) for the Italian translation of the course.",

It makes the world visible to us, is the major driver of the 24-hr sleep-wake cycle to which not only humans, but virtually all life on earth (fauna and flora) submits. In fact, there would be no life on earth without light. It is therefore hard to overestimate the impact light has on humans, biologically, psychologically, socially. And yet, we hardly ever think or speak about light.\n\nLIGHTCAP’s 2 “Basics of light and its effects on humans: Light, cognition, alertness, sleep” covers light as a physical phenomenon and introduces important psychological and chronobiological outcomes – how to measure them and how light acts on them.  The course is one in a series of four, each with a different disciplinary basis and with complementary perspectives to the domain of light for humans. The basis of this course is a combination of physics, psychology and chronobiology.\n\nIn this course you will:\n(1) be introduced to important concepts such as cognition, alertness and sleepiness and self-report tools to measure them  \n(2) learn what light is.

In this way, your quantitative analysis will become useful for informed decision-making. You will be able to detect and quantify dependence on non-renewable resources and externalization of environmental problems to other societies and ecosystems (a popular ‘solution’ in the western world).  Practical case studies, from both developed and developing countries, will help you evaluate the state-of-play of a given community or country and to evaluate possible solutions. Last but not least, you will learn to see pressing social-ecological issues, such as energy poverty, water scarcity and inequity, from a radically different perspective, and to question everything you’ve been told so far.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nPart of the results and case studies presented have been developed within two projects: MAGIC and PARTICIPIA. However, the course does not reflect the views of the funding institutions or of the project partners as a whole, and the case studies were presented purely with an educational and illustrative purpose.",

        "description": "머신 러닝. 여러분 팀이 필요로 하는 것, 여러분 상사가 요구하는 것, 그리고 여러분의 커리어가 사랑하는 것입니다. LinkedIn은 '기업이 가장 필요로 하는 역량' 중 하나이자 미국 내 가장 부상하고 있는 직군으로 머신 러닝을 꼽았습니다.\n\n머신 러닝(일명 '예측 분석')을 배포하기 위해서는, 그 작동 원리를 알아야 합니다. 자신이 실무자가 아닌 기업가라 해도(직접 수치를 다루지 않는 경우), 전반적인 프로젝트를 처리하기 위해서는 머신 러닝의 기본 메커니즘을 파악하고 있어야 합니다. 다시 말해 경영진, 의사결정권자, 또는 운영 관리자 등 직무와 관계없이 예측 모델을 통합하여 의사 결정을 내리는 방법을 감독하는 사람이라면, 가지고 있는 정보가 많을수록 더 나은 결과를 얻을 수 있습니다.\n\n작동 원리를 자세히 살펴보는 일은 아주 재미있을 겁니다. 머신 러닝의 메커니즘은 흥미롭고 놀라울 뿐 아니라, 직관적으로도 이해가 쉽습니다. 전 세계적으로 머신 러닝의 영향력이 빠르게 커지고 있습니다. 이제는 데이터 예측력을 입증하고, 이를 과학적으로 활용하는 방법을 명확히 해야 할 때입니다.\n\n본 강좌는 머신 러닝의 작동 원리를 다루고 있습니다. 복잡한 계산 없이 기초적인 원리, 데이터에서 통찰력을 얻는 방법, 이러한 통찰력을 신뢰할 수 있는 방법, 예측 모델의 성능은 어느 정도인지 등을 살펴봅니다. 이는 분석 전문가들 뿐 아니라 모든 비즈니스 전문가에게도 필요한 내용입니다.\n\n또한 본 강좌에서는 일반적인 수준의 머신 러닝과 더불어 최신 고급 기법을 다룰 뿐 아니라, 굉장히 흔하지만 간과하기 쉬운 함정을 피할 수 있는 방법을 제시합니다. 본 강좌에서는 이러한 주제를 심층적으로 다루고 있지만, 기술적인 지식이 없는 학습자와 입문자도 쉽게 이해할 수 있도록 구성되었습니다.\n\n본 강좌에서는 다음과 같이 성능이 우수하거나 그렇지 않은 기법, 그리고 그 경계에 있는 기법 등을 다루고 있으며, 이를 통해 어떤 기법이 효과적인지를 학습합니다.\n\n– 의사결정 나무, 로지스틱 회귀, 신경망 등 예측 모델링 알고리즘의 작동 원리\n\n– 과적합, p-해킹, 상관관계로부터 인과관계를 추정하는 오류 등의 위험한 함정\n\n– 예측 모델을 해석하는 방법과 그 작동 원리를 설명하는 방법\n\n– 앙상블 모델링, 업리프트 모델링(일명 ‘설득 모델링’) 등의 고급 기법\n\n– 수많은 머신 러닝 소프트웨어 옵션 중 툴을 선정하는 방법\n\n– 비즈니스 측면에서의 예측 모델 평가 방법\n\n– 보호 계층에 대한 잠재적 편향이 내재된 예측 모델을 가려내는 방법 (AI 윤리)\n\n심층적인 주제를 쉽게 풀이. Columbia University 교수 시절 티칭 어워드를 수상한, 업계 선두주자 Eric Siegel이 여러분을 초대합니다. 본 커리큘럼은 심도 있는 내용으로 수강생의 참여를 유도하며, 머신 러닝이라는 주제를 놀라울 정도로 쉽게 풀이하는 과정 중 하나로 손꼽힙니다.\n\n이론 중심, 복잡한 계산 배제. 본 강좌에서는 실습보다는, 비즈니스 리더와 급부상하는 데이터 과학자 모두가 활용할 수 있도록 최신 기술과 가장 치명적인 함정을 폭넓게 다루고 있습니다. 따라서 코딩이나 머신 러닝 소프트웨어 사용과 관련된 실습은 진행하지 않습니다. 예외적으로, 평가 과제 중 하나로 Excel 또는 Google Sheets를 통해 예측 모델을 직접 만들어보고, 해당 모델이 어떻게 개선되는지 눈으로 직접 확인하는 실습 과정이 포함되어 있습니다.\n\n전문적 지식을 갖춘 수강생에게도 적합한 강의. 바로 실습에 뛰어들기 전에, 분석 전문가들처럼 잘 생각해 보세요. 이 커리큘럼은 훌륭한 기술 전문가들에게도 필요한 여러 보충적 노하우를 제공합니다. 이 강의는 탄탄한 개념 구조 속에 핵심 기술을 위치시킵니다. 또한 대부분의 기술 분야 강좌에서 다루지 않는 업리프트 모델링(설득 모델링)이나 위험한 함정에 대해서도 다루고 있습니다. \n\n벤더 중립적. 본 강좌에는 SAS 제품을 사용한 머신 러닝 소프트웨어 데모 강의가 포함되어 있습니다. 그러나 이 커리큘럼은 벤더 중립적이며. 범용적으로 적용될 수 있습니다. 본 강좌에서 다루는 내용과 학습 목표는 어떤 머신 러닝 소프트웨어 툴을 사용하느냐에 관계없이 적용됩니다.\n\n선행강좌. 본 강좌를 수강하기에 앞서, 전문 강좌의 'The Power of Machine Learning'(강좌 1)과 'Launching Machine Learning'(강좌 2)을 먼저 수강하시기 바랍니다.",

Beginning with an introduction to the course structure, objectives, and foundational Blender skills, you will dive into essential 3D modeling techniques. You will learn how to effectively use references to create your first basic model—the grey box, before advancing to seams, sharps, and UV mapping for optimal texture application. Along the way, you’ll explore the role of nodes and materials, ensuring your windmill looks as realistic as possible.\n\nThe course progresses by focusing on each part of the windmill, starting from the base structure to detailed wood and stonework, making sure your model is grounded in realistic proportions and texturing. You will learn how to expertly manipulate Blender's tools, including booleans and transformations, to craft believable wood joints, supports, and other architectural elements. The lessons also cover the introduction of complex shaders, windows, and other intricate parts that will breathe life into your 3D model.\n\nAs you refine your creation, you’ll gain insights into cloth modeling for the windmill's sails, mastering proportional editing, and preparing the windmill arms for seamless material application. By the end of the course, you will have a polished, game-ready windmill fully integrated into Unreal Engine 5. Whether you’re new to 3D modeling or looking to sharpen your prop creation skills, this course offers the tools and techniques needed to bring your artistic vision to life.\n\nThis course is designed for aspiring 3D artists, game designers, and developers with a basic understanding of Blender and Unreal Engine.

Cuando los cuidados de salud descansan en una perspectiva de cuidado individual, la evidencia empírica muestra que los sistemas de salud tienden al colapso. Por lo mismo, es fundamental aprehender el concepto sanitario desde una perspectiva colectiva. \n\nEl curso está dirigido a cualquiera que tenga interés en temas de salud pública, sean simplemente personas interesadas, estudiantes de pregrado, técnicos o estudiantes de post grado con carreras afines. Se divide en cuatro módulos, donde se verán conceptos tales como: las bases de la salud pública, cómo esta actúa, conceptos sociodemográficos y los logros y principales desafíos que presenta hoy la salud pública en el mundo y en Chile.",

        "description": "Philosophy, Science and Religion mark three of the most fundamental modes of thinking about the world and our place in it. Are these modes incompatible? Put another way: is the intellectually responsible thing to do to ‘pick sides’ and identify with one of these approaches at the exclusion of others? Or, are they complementary or mutually supportive? As is typical of questions of such magnitude, the devil is in the details. For example, it is important to work out what is really distinctive about each of these ways of inquiring about the world. In order to gain some clarity here, we’ll be investigating what some of the current leading thinkers in philosophy, science and religion are actually doing.\n\nThis course, entitled ‘Religion and Science’, is the third of three related courses in our Philosophy, Science and Religion Online series. The course will address five themes, each presented by an expert in the area. \n\n1. Science, Religion, and the Origin of the Universe (Professor Tim Maudlin, NYU )\n2. Buddhism and Science (Professor Graham Priest, CUNY)\n3. Evolution and Design (Dr Kevin Scharp, St Andrews)\n4. Sin Suffering and Salvation: Evolutions Thorny Issues (Dr Bethany Sollereder, Oxford)\n5. Human Uniqueness in Science, Theology, and Ethics (Professor David Clough, Chester)\n\nThe first and second courses in the Philosophy, Science and Religion series, 'Science and Philosophy' and 'Philosophy and Religion' were launched in 2017 and you can sign up to these at any time. It is not necessary to have completed these courses to follow this course. However, completing all three courses will give you a broader understanding of this fascinating topic. Look for: \n\n• Philosophy, Science and Religion I: Science and Philosophy - https://www.coursera.org/learn/philosophy-science-religion-1\n• Philosophy, Science and Religion II: Philosophy and Religion - https://www.coursera.org/learn/philosophy-science-religion-2\n\nUpon successful completion of all three courses, students will:\n\n(1) Understand the main parameters at stake in the current debate between science and religion.\n(2) Have some familiarity with the relevant areas of science that feature in the debate—including cosmology, evolution, and the neurosciences—and will have begun to engage with them conceptually.\n(3) Have encountered key philosophical approaches to the interface between science and religion, and will have had the opportunity to engage them in practice.\n(4) Have embarked constructively in cross-disciplinary conversations.\n(5) Have demonstrated an openness to personal growth through a commitment to dialogue across intellectual and spiritual boundaries.\n\nYou can also follow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/EdiPhilOnline and you can follow the hashtag #psrmooc",

Every day, a vast amount of evidence is generated that is relevant to humanitarian actors, much of it through research by academics and practitioners. This evidence can be incredibly valuable. It can help us better understand a situation and make humanitarian action more effective and accountable. The difficulty comes with understanding what evidence is relevant to our circumstances, where to find it, and how to assess its quality.\n\nThis course will provide you with the fundamental knowledge and skills to answer these questions and help you better engage with research. It has been developed with you - a humanitarian professional or junior researcher - in mind. The course moves through the core research concepts one-at-a-time and does not require any prior knowledge or experience. We encourage all of you to plan your own learning journey by using this MOOC in a way that is most useful to you. \n\nContent highlights:\n   • How can research be used for humanitarian practice? \n   • What are the most appropriate research methods? \n   • How can I judge the quality of the evidence and whether it is applicable to the context I work in? \n   • How can populations in a situation of vulnerability be protected during a study?\n\nThis course - co-developed in a partnership between academic and humanitarian institutions - is strongly positioned to give you the needed skills and knowledge to build a bridge between research and practice.\n\nWe hope that this course will change your perspectives and improve your knowledge and, ultimately, make humanitarian responses more evidence-based.

        "description": "Developed by David Owens at Vanderbilt University and customized for the cultural sector with National Arts Strategies, this course is designed to help arts and culture leaders create an environment where new ideas are constantly created, shared, evaluated and the best ones are successfully put to work.\n\nOne of the toughest challenges for any leader is getting traction for new ideas. Winning support can be a struggle. As a result, powerful new ideas often get stuck. This is especially true in the cultural sector. People involved in arts and culture often have little time and even less money for experimentation and risks. This course will help those in the performing arts, museums, zoos, libraries and other cultural organizations build environments where new management and program ideas flourish.\n\nLeading Innovation in Arts & Culture will teach you how to make an \"innovation strategy\" a fundamental component of your organization's overall strategy. In this seminar you will learn to:\n\n- Analyze constraints on innovation in your organization, foresee obstacles and opportunities, and develop a shared vision\n- Develop a process to manage the demands of multiple stakeholders, shifting priorities and the uncertainty inherent in new initiatives\n- Create a culture for innovation and risk-taking that generates new perspectives and challenges existing practice\n- Create a strong customer focus within your organization that anticipates customer needs\n\nNational Arts Strategies worked with David Owens to customize this course for those working in the cultural sector. They based their work on David Owens’ Leading Strategic Innovation in Organizations course. This highly interactive 8-week course will engage you in a series of class discussions and exercises.",

This course offers a systematic approach to enhance the accuracy and reliability of your LLM applications.\n\nYou will build an SQL agent, add evaluation metrics to measure performance, and use prompt engineering and self-reflection to make the model perform better. Finally, you will fine-tune the model with techniques like LoRA and memory tuning that embeds facts in model weights to reduce hallucinations.\n\nIn this course, you’ll use Llama’s family of open-source models.\n\nWhat you’ll do: \n\n1. Build a text to SQL agent and simulate situations where it hallucinates to begin the evaluation process. \n\n2. Build an evaluation framework to systematically measure performance, including criteria for good evaluations, best practices, and how to develop an evaluation score. \n\n3. Learn how instruction fine-tuning enhances pre-trained LLMs to follow instructions, and how memory fine-tuning embeds facts to reduce hallucinations. \n\n4. Break fine-tuning myths and see how Performance-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA) reduce training time by 100x and Mixture of Memory Experts (MoME) reduces it even further. \n\n5. Go through an iterative process of generating training data and fine-tuning, learning practical tips such as adding examples, generating variations, and filtering generated data to increase model accuracy. \n\nStart improving the accuracy of LLM applications today!",

        "description": "Delve into the research behind terrorism as you unpack the assumptions and impacts of both terrorism and counterterrorism.\n\nTerrorism has arguably been one of the defining factors of our age. It frequently makes headlines, threatening or attacking governments, private businesses, and ordinary citizens. In many parts of the world, it has been one of the most important threats to peace, security, and stability – but what does this mean exactly? \n\nOn this six-week course from Leiden University, you’ll explore the essence of terrorism and discover why it is so difficult to define. Unpacking its history and the theory of the waves of terrorism, you’ll analyse both the theoretical approaches and practical applications of terrorism and counterterrorism in the real world.\n\nThere are many assumptions that cloud the subjects of terrorism and counterterrorism. These myths are often created and intensified by individual bias, the government, and the media. On this course, you’ll discover different assumptions about terrorist identities and motivations, as well as the efficiencies of various counterterrorism efforts. You’ll then compare this with academic research to investigate the truth behind these assumptions.\n\nIn your exploration of the impact of terrorism, you’ll delve into the culture of fear created by terrorism, as well as the success of counterterrorism policies to limit and manage its impact on society.  In the final stage of this course, you’ll reflect on trends and developments in terrorism and counterterrorism. You’ll assess current academic research as well as what could be studied in the future to help.",

Ils sont bercés par une certaine illusion que les preuves de la science forensique sont infaillibles et fournissent des résultats factuels sûrs à 100 %. Ce cours – dispensé par des spécialistes du domaine – dépasse l’image conventionnelle véhiculée par des séries télévisées comme « Les Experts ». Il alerte (sans alarmer) le public sur les limites des techniques afin de promouvoir une bonne gestion administrative de la science forensique dans le système de justice pénale. Il permet aux participant·e·s de comprendre l’importance du raisonnement probabiliste en sciences forensiques, car l’incertitude fait partie intégrante de celle-ci. Le cours s’articule autour d’une série de causes célèbres qui auraient pu ou ont mené à des erreurs judiciaires.

This project is beginner-friendly.\n\nWe will visualize the current global scenario of Covid-19 using bar graphs and scatter plots followed by geographical data visualization using Choropleth maps. Then we will dive into medical analysis. We will then visualize how Covid deaths vary with respect to age group and how various pre-existing medical conditions vary with age. Then we will visualize and analyze how various medical conditions contribute to Covid death. We will also compare the performance of all the 50 states in the US against Covid. In the final task, we will finish by creating WordCloud text visualization of various medical conditions and condition groups that contribute to Covid deaths.\n\nNote: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. We’re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.",

We will begin the journey of Implant Dentistry by exploring how discoveries in biology and technological developments lead to the current practice of dental implants. Then, we will examine clinical cases, diagnose our patients’ needs and expectations and learn the principles of treatment planning. We will learn step-by-step surgical procedures for placing implants and various restorative techniques, directed by current evidence and best practices. Finally, we will investigate major threats and complications of implant procedures and ways to ensure successful treatments and long serving implants.\n\nWhat is the aim of the course?\nThis MOOC has a strong clinical focus and is especially designed to enhance professional learning among dental practitioners and dental students. The course aims to help the students LEARN the fundamentals of implant dentistry, UNDERSTAND the treatment procedures and protocols, and APPLY the competences gained through interactive peer and case based learning. \n\nWho is the course for?\nThe course is specially designed to serve multiple groups of learners: From intermediate and experienced general dental practitioners who want to establish and deepen their knowledge in implant dentistry and advance towards implementing implant treatment and restorative procedures, to dental students and recent graduates who wish to gain understanding of implant dentistry and increase their competence in related practice.\n\nThe course makes good use of evidenced-based education, sound eLearning pedagogies and 21st century “live” resources to engage and create the best learning experience for our students.",

        "description": "In this course, students in the health and information technology professions will examine models for interprofessional collaboration and teamwork, practice communication techniques to promote effective interaction, and envision futures literacy in interprofessional informatics scenarios. We will hear from nurses and other informaticians who are leading and working interprofessionally, and glean insights from their diverse perspectives. When we think about the requisite variety of leadership skills that are essential in nursing informatics, we may deduce that leadership in interprofessional informatics will demand at least that diversity or more. We’ll expand our nursing informatics leadership vision to include interprofessional applications of the Competing Values Framework and the Minnesota Nursing Informatics Leadership Inventory. \n\nFor students who are interested in completing the specialization, there is a sixth module in this course dedicated to the creation of a portfolio which is peer reviewed. The purpose of the portfolio is to help students integrate, synthesize and document their learning through completion of the five course specialization.\n\nStudents will:\nDefine the term interprofessionality to support the development of an interprofessional informatics leadership skill set \n\nDescribe how the competing values framework supports knowledge leadership and interprofessional informatics practice to achieve collective impact in health care contexts \n\nExplain the core competencies expected to support culturally-sensitive interprofessional practice to deepen leadership insights in interprofessional informatics \n\nDiscuss selected policy, practice, and standardization issues related to knowledge representation and framing to support interprofessional informatics practice \n\nAnalyze the future of interprofessional informatics leadership to develop an anticipatory leadership skill set",

        "description": "This course will highlight the potential of quantitative marketing research for assessing new product opportunities. In addition to focusing on the skills and practices for a successful New Product Development (NPD), the course will illustrate the multi-faceted challenges of NPD using authentic business situations. The first module will provide business practice foundations to help learners devise creative solutions to problems using a design-thinking framework. Learners will experience the idea creation process and then apply the role of surveys for evaluating consumer responses to an idea before introducing a product to market. The second module will explore the technique of conjoint analysis for quantifying the customer benefits, customer values, and the trade-off he or she is willing to make between the price of the product and desired features of the product or service. Concept testing identifies perceptions, wants, and needs of a product or service as the foundation of targeting and positioning a product in the marketplace. The third module will describe a multitude of tools for assessing technology readiness and defining the product features to target the key customer need requirements. Learners will hear an in-depth interview with one of the leading U.S. business executives on the management challenges of innovation. Learners will develop a survey (with appropriate data privacy agreements) and analyze the data for decisions about the pricing and positioning a new product into a focused market. The fourth module will illustrate the use of the tools to create a sales and pricing forecast for a new product. Three new product ideas representing three different types of market unknowns will be analyzed using market research tools. Upon completion of this course, the learner will have defined and redefined their product idea and created a credible sales forecast for use in an overall business case.",
